[1.1]\n1.1 Leading the Happiest of Lives\nPresident Ikeda\u2019s conception of happiness is an inspiring teaching for all, imparting courage to those overwhelmed by suffering and hope to those shrouded in despair.\n\nThis first chapter introduces this all-embracing concept of happiness.\n\nIn this selection, President Ikeda responds to questions from members in Thailand about the purpose of life and how we should live our lives.\n\u201cHow do I live my life?\u201d \u201cHow can I live the very best life?\u201d\u2014these are fundamental questions. How to live is an inescapable issue that confronts all who are born in this world, one that has been pursued by countless philosophies, ideologies, and religions. At the most basic level, politics, economics, and science, too, are inseparable from this issue. Their original purpose is to help people live the happiest of lives. None of these areas of human endeavor, however, can provide an answer to the question \u201cWhat constitutes the best life?\u201d They have no clear or conclusive answer that is rationally convincing.\n\nBuddhism supplies a coherent answer to this question. Shakyamuni Buddha, the Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai, and Nichiren Daishonin each set forth a clear response. In particular, the conclusions of Shakyamuni and the Daishonin are exactly the same.\n\nMoreover, based on his conclusion, Nichiren Daishonin left behind a concrete \u201ctool\u201d that all people can use to become happy. He bestowed the Gohonzon\u2014which second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda referred to as a \u201chappiness-producing device\u201d\u2014upon all humankind.\n\nWhat is the definition of human happiness? There is a Thai saying, \u201cFalse happiness makes people become haughty and arrogant. Real happiness makes people joyful and fills them with wisdom and compassion.\u201d*1\n\nIs one happy just because one is wealthy? All too many people have allowed money to ruin their lives.\n\nPresident Toda stressed the importance of absolute happiness over relative happiness. Absolute happiness is not how one stands compared with others, nor is it a transitory, illusory happiness that fades with the passing of time. Mr. Toda taught that we practice Nichiren Buddhism to attain a state of life where, no matter what circumstances we may encounter, we can feel that life itself is a joy. When we attain that state of life, our lives overflow with unsurpassed joy, wisdom, and compassion\u2014just as the Thai proverb says: \u201cReal happiness makes people joyful and fills them with wisdom and compassion.\u201d\n\nThe Daishonin states: \u201cBoth oneself and others together will take joy in their possession of wisdom and compassion\u201d (OTT, 146). Our practice of Nichiren Buddhism and our organization for kosen-rufu exist so that we, and also others, may attain absolute happiness.\n\nAll kinds of things happen in life. There is sorrow, there is suffering. Every day, there are things we may find unpleasant or annoying. Married couples may sometimes quarrel. Even if a couple does get on well, they may have a sick child, or one of them may suffer illness. We face all kinds of sufferings and problems. How formidable are the challenges of living!\n\nFaith is the engine that enables us to persevere in life to the very end. Our Buddhist practice serves as the propulsive force for piercing through the clouds of suffering like a rocket and powerfully ascending higher and higher, without limit, to fly serenely through the skies of happiness.\n\nWhen we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, hope and the strength to always live positively surge within us. Buddhism teaches that earthly desires\u2014deluded impulses that are a cause of suffering\u2014can be a springboard to enlightenment. Through faith in the Mystic Law, we can develop the ability to change all that is negative in our lives into something positive. We can transform all problems into happiness, sufferings into joy, anxiety into hope, and worry into peace of mind. We will always be able to find a way forward.\n\nThe Daishonin writes: \u201cMyo [of myoho, the Mystic Law] means to revive, that is, to return to life\u201d (WND-1, 149). It is the immense power of the Mystic Law that gives vitality to and breathes fresh life into all things, including individuals, organizations, societies, and nations.\n\nAs human beings, we also possess our own unique karma. You may wish you could have been born into a wealthier family, but the reality is that you weren\u2019t. There are many areas in life where karma comes into play. Essentially, the concept of karma can only be understood when viewed from the perspective of life\u2019s eternity over the three existences of past, present, and future. There are past existences and the law of cause and effect to take into account.\n\nAnd these past existences may not necessarily all have been on this planet. Many in astronomy and related fields today think that, given the enormously vast numbers of stars and planets in the known universe, other intelligent life forms similar to human beings must exist.\n\nIn any case, our present reality is that we have been born here on Earth. This is an inalterable fact. How can we discover our true path? How can we change our karma and build a truly wonderful and meaningful existence? The answer is, in short, by embracing faith in the Mystic Law. Through our practice of Nichiren Buddhism, we can change any negative karma and transform the place where we are into the Land of Tranquil Light*2, a place overflowing with happiness.\n\nMoreover, Nichiren Buddhism focuses on the present and the future. By always moving forward from this moment on, we can develop our lives boundlessly. We can also open up infinite possibilities for our next life and lifetimes after that. We can reveal the immeasurable treasures within us and make our lives shine with the full brilliance of those treasures. Such is the power of practicing Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nFrom a speech at a Soka Gakkai Thailand general meeting, Thailand, February 6, 1994.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Translated from Thai.

The Buddha land, which is free from impermanence and impurity. In many sutras, the actual saha world in which human beings dwell is described as an impure land filled with delusions and sufferings, while the Buddha land is described as a pure land free from these and far removed from this saha world. In contrast, the Lotus Sutra reveals the saha world to be the Buddha land, or the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light, and explains that the nature of a land is determined by the minds of its inhabitants.\nPreface\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 1:\nWhat Is True Happiness?

[1.2]\n1.2 Absolute Happiness and Relative Happiness\nHow, in the face of the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death, can we lead positive and fulfilling lives? In this selection, President Ikeda describes a life of limitless value creation in pursuit of absolute happiness by cultivating a strong life force and bounteous wisdom.\nWhat is the purpose of life? It is happiness. The goal of Buddhism and of faith, too, is to become happy.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cThere is no true happiness for human beings other than chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. The [Lotus Sutra] reads, \u2018. . . where living beings enjoy themselves at ease\u2019 [LSOC16, 272]\u201d (WND-1, 681). \u201cEnjoy themselves at ease\u201d here means being freely able to live the kind of life one desires and wholeheartedly enjoying that life.\n\nIf you possess strong life force and abundant wisdom, it is possible to enjoy the challenge of overcoming life\u2019s hardships in much the same way that waves make surfing exhilarating and steep mountains give mountaineering its appeal.\n\nBecause the Mystic Law is the source of the life force and wisdom for overcoming life\u2019s difficulties, the Daishonin states that there is no greater happiness than chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.\n\nReality is harsh. Please courageously challenge the stern realities of life and win, and win again, in everything\u2014in daily life, work, school, and family relations. The teachings of Buddhism and our practice of faith are the driving force for unlimited improvement.\n\nWhere people possess wisdom and life force derived from their Buddhist practice, they can move everything in a brighter, more positive, and more encouraging direction. Wise, genuine practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism are able to enter into a winning rhythm in actuality, not just in theory.\n\nSecond Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda gave the following guidance on happiness:\n\n\u201cI would like to say a few words about happiness. There are two kinds of happiness: absolute happiness and relative happiness. Absolute happiness is attaining Buddhahood. . . . Relative happiness means that your everyday wishes are fulfilled one by one\u2014for instance, to have a million yen, a wonderful spouse, fine children, a nice house or clothes, and so on. . . . Such happiness is not of great consequence. Yet everyone is convinced that this is what being happy is all about.\n\n\u201cWhat, then, is absolute happiness? Absolute happiness means that being alive and here itself is a joy. . . . It also implies a state where one is free of financial worries and enjoys adequate good health, where there is peace and harmony in one\u2019s family and one\u2019s business prospers, and where all that one sees and hears brings one a wonderful sense of pleasure and joy. When we achieve such a state of life, this world, this strife-ridden saha world, will itself become a pure land. This is what we call attaining the state of Buddhahood. . . .\n\n\u201cHow can we achieve this? We must shift from the pursuit of relative happiness to that of absolute happiness. Only our practice of Nichiren Buddhism can make this happen. I\u2019m working furiously to share this truth with others; so I hope you will have utter confidence in my words and lead such lives [of absolute happiness].\u201d*1\n\nFounding Soka Gakkai president Tsunesaburo Makiguchi once said: \u201cThere are some people who go around saying, \u2018I saved the money I wanted, bought the house I wanted, so now I can sit back, enjoy a drink, and indulge in a few luxuries. What more can I want in life than that?\u2019 This kind of person has no understanding of the true purpose of life.\u201d On this point, Mr. Makiguchi clearly stated: \u201cThe purpose of life is to create supreme value and to attain the greatest happiness.\u201d\n\nThe name Soka Gakkai (lit. Value-Creating Society) means an organization whose members are committed to creating supreme value and attaining the greatest happiness.\n\nThe purpose of life is to realize this kind of happiness, in other words, absolute happiness. Absolute happiness is something that doesn\u2019t change with time; it is eternal and unaffected by external factors, welling forth from the depths of one\u2019s life. It is not a transitory thing like worldly status and fortune or some other fleeting satisfaction.\n\nWhat matters is living in accord with the Law and attaining an elevated state of life based on the Law. The state of life we attain, like the Law itself, is eternal. As practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism, we can make our way as champions of life throughout eternity.\n\nSome people say that happiness is just a state of mind and that if you think you\u2019re happy you will be, even if you\u2019re suffering from illness or poverty. But if it\u2019s just something you\u2019re telling yourself without actually feeling any real sense of happiness in the depths of your being, then it\u2019s ultimately meaningless.\n\nThe \u201ctreasures of the heart\u201d that we accumulate through our practice of Nichiren Buddhism will manifest in our lives over time as \u201ctreasures of the body\u201d and \u201ctreasures of the storehouse\u201d (cf. WND-1, 851).\n\nEvery day, I am earnestly praying that you may enjoy comfortable lives, good health, and longevity. And I will continue to pray wholeheartedly for this as long as I live. It is my ardent wish that you each fulfill all of your heart\u2019s desires, so that you can declare in your closing days, \u201cMy life has been a happy one. I have no regrets. It has been a satisfying life.\u201d\n\n\nFrom a speech at a Rio de Janeiro general meeting, Brazil, February 13, 1993.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Translated from Japanese.

[1.3]\n1.3 Happiness Is Forged amid Life\u2019s Challenges\nTrue happiness is not a matter of chance. It is forged through our earnest efforts to grapple with life\u2019s many challenges.\nI would like to talk a little about the subject of happiness. Happiness is the fundamental goal of life. It is also the goal of faith. And it is the goal of Buddhism. It is extremely important, then, to understand just what happiness is. I think it is fair to say that people in all ages and places have earnestly sought the answer to the question \u201cWhat is happiness?\u201d and that, for all too many today, it still remains unanswered.\n\nSome possess great material wealth but are unhappy, perhaps becoming mean-spirited or doing nothing but fighting and quarreling with others. On the other hand, it is quite possible to be materially poor yet enjoy great happiness, being pure-hearted and seeing the beauty in all things like a poet.\n\nHappiness is something very personal. Of two people in similar circumstances, one may be unhappy and the other happy. People are all different and perceive things differently. The reality of people\u2019s lives is infinitely diverse.\n\nFor instance, there are many women who, though they seem to have good fortune when they are single\u2014possessing youth, beauty, and wealth\u2014end up extremely sad and unhappy when they get married. Living like a princess in a palace, eating food from gold plates, and wearing stylish, immaculate clothing is not happiness. It is in fact stifling and boring, illusory and empty. Though people in such circumstances may seem to be very happy, it is all a show; in reality, their happiness is very fragile and fleeting.\n\nSome, on the other hand, may appear to be suffering misfortune, but are, with strong determination and dignity, forging a life state of happiness that is like a magnificent painting.\n\nBy surviving the tragic misfortunes of youth and experiencing many times the hardship of others, we can lead lives that are many times richer, filled with tremendous vitality and inner strength in our final chapter.\n\nIf our lives are always smooth sailing, we\u2019ll never be able to savor real happiness. It goes without saying that the treasure of happiness cannot be found in a life of ease and idleness. The diamond of happiness can only be found by making our way into the deep mountain recesses of life with great effort and exertion. It is not to be found in idly seeking fun and pleasure amid the bustle and bright lights of the city or in leading an easy existence.\n\nThe renowned Scottish poet Robert Burns had this to say about happiness in one of his verses [that in Standard English translation reads]:\n\nIf happiness have not her seat\nAnd center in the breast,\nWe may be wise, or rich, or great,\nBut never can be blessed!\nNo treasures nor pleasures\nCould make us happy long:\nThe heart always is the part always\nThat makes us right or wrong.*1\n\nIn other words, happiness and unhappiness, ultimately, are found within us. As Nichiren Daishonin says: \u201cIt is the heart that is important\u201d (WND-1, 1000).\n\nFrom a message to a nationwide young women\u2019s division leaders meeting, June 16, 1999.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Cf. Robert Burns, \u201cEpistle to Davie, A Brother Poet,\u201d The Complete Poetical Works of Robert Burns, 1759\u20131796 , edited by James A. Mackay (Darvel, Scotland: Alloway Publishing Ltd., 1993), p. 87.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 1:\nWhat Is True Happiness? [1.2]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 1:\nWhat Is True Happiness? [1.4]"}, {"title": "chapter-1-4.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 1:\nWhat Is True Happiness? [1.4]\n1.4 Happiness Lies within Us\nIn this selection, President Ikeda outlines the Buddhist way of life\u2014opening the palace of happiness within our lives instead of seeking it outside, and helping others do the same.\nWhere is the palace of happiness, the indestructible bastion of happiness, that so many are eagerly seeking? And how is it to be acquired?\n\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, Nichiren Daishonin states: \u201cChanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is what is meant by entering the palace of oneself\u201d (OTT, 209).\n\nThe indestructible life state of Buddhahood exists within us all. It could be described as an everlasting palace of happiness, adorned with countless glittering treasures. By embracing faith in the Mystic Law and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we can enter this palace within our lives. In other words, the Daishonin teaches that we have the capacity to make the \u201cpalace of oneself\u201d shine with supreme brilliance.\n\nPeople seek all kinds of worldly \u201cpalaces of happiness.\u201d Some seek wealth or social standing, while others wish for fame, celebrity, or popularity. But none of those things have the permanence of a steadfast mountain peak. In our ever-changing existences, they are like the light of fireflies, flickering beautifully but destined to fade and disappear all too soon.\n\nA life spent in pursuit of the ephemeral, transitory glories of the world is also ephemeral and transitory. Chasing eagerly after forms of happiness that are insubstantial and impermanent is a sad and empty way to live.\n\nAs the Daishonin says, one\u2019s own highest state of life is an eternal and indestructible palace, a true bastion of happiness.\n\nPeople may live in fine houses or possess great wealth, but if their hearts are mean and their life conditions are low, they will not be truly happy; they will be dwelling in palaces of misery. In contrast, people who have beautiful, generous hearts and a high life condition, irrespective of their present circumstances, are certain to attain both material and spiritual happiness. This accords with the Buddhist principle of the oneness of life and its environment\u2014that our lives and our surroundings are one and inseparable.\n\nWhen we open the palace of our own lives, it will eventually lead to the \u201cpalace of happiness\u201d opening in others\u2019 lives and the \u201cpalace of prosperity\u201d opening in society. There is an underlying continuity between the process of opening one\u2019s own palace and others doing likewise. This is a wonderful principle of Buddhism.\n\nIn today\u2019s complex society, where it is all too easy to succumb to negative influences, the wisdom to live mindfully and meaningfully is crucial. Our Buddhist practice enables us to open up our lives and become happy. By continuing to develop and deepen our faith and wisdom, we can become true champions as human beings and ongoing victors in the journey of life.\n\nSupreme happiness is savored by those who, through practicing Nichiren Buddhism, make the palace of their lives shine eternally throughout the three existences of past, present, and future.\n\nYou are each building and opening your own palace of happiness day by day through your activities for kosen-rufu. You are certain, as a result, to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime and to become noble champions of happiness dwelling in a great palace of life as vast as the universe itself. I hope you will continue forging ahead on the great path of faith with confidence and optimism, filled with strong conviction and pride.\n\nFrom a speech at a Nagano Prefecture general meeting, Nagano, August 12, 1990.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 1:\nWhat Is True Happiness? [1.3]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 1:\nWhat Is True Happiness? [1.5]"}, {"title": "chapter-1-5.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 1:\nWhat Is True Happiness? [1.5]\n1.5 Creating a Life of Genuine Freedom\nAt the 1st Nationwide Women\u2019s Division Leaders Meeting in April 1988, President Ikeda proposed designating May 3 as Soka Gakkai Mothers Day. In his speech at this historic meeting, he discussed what it means to live with true freedom.\nWhat is freedom? How can we fully enjoy freedom? Countless sages and philosophers over the centuries have pondered this. In fact, quite apart from this intellectual quest, all people long for freedom. People wish to live freely, without constraints or limitations. This is an innate human desire. Even if we can\u2019t clearly define it, we all know that freedom is a vital condition for happiness.\n\nAnd though all seek freedom, very few attain it in the truest sense.\n\nHow can human beings themselves change, and how can we gain an understanding of the real nature of life? These are the most fundamental challenges facing humanity. In this respect, the religious revolution we of the Soka Gakkai are carrying out based on the principles of Nichiren Buddhism is key. You are all noble trailblazers in this endeavor.\n\nOur environment is important, but it is not everything, nor is it absolute. Mr. Toda attained a life state of eternal freedom in a prison cell, the most constrained of environments.\n\nSome of you may feel as if you\u2019re \u201cfettered\u201d by your mother-in-law, or \u201ctied down\u201d by your children! Or your husband, your household chores, or your job may at times all seem like heavy iron chains!\n\nIn your activities for kosen-rufu, too, things may happen that weigh you down so much that you feel bound and tied.\n\nYou might exclaim to yourself: \u201cAh, I\u2019m just a prisoner!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a servant to my husband and children!\u201d\n\nYou may envy some people for the apparent ease of their lives, but if you look closely, you will find that they have no real freedom either.\n\nWe must develop inner freedom\u2014a true freedom that exists on a deeper level than what we can achieve by simply changing our intellectual outlook or point of view.\n\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, the Daishonin states: \u201cOutside of each instant of thought of our deluded minds there is no Buddha mind. The births and deaths of [us living beings of] the nine worlds are the true reality . . . , and hence we can \u2018freely choose.\u2019 Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is being \u2018free to choose\u2019\u201d (OTT, 212). In other words, the world of Buddhahood does not exist apart from our deluded lives as ordinary people in the nine worlds [the life states of hell through bodhisattva]. Throughout the cycle of birth and death, we have been fettered by earthly desires, karma, and suffering, but when illuminated by the Mystic Law, our lives reveal their true inherent nature and become utterly free. By chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the Daishonin tells us, we can live with absolute freedom.\n\nFreedom is not found somewhere apart from the seeming constraints of the nine worlds, of life\u2019s realities. Nor is true freedom found in escaping reality. Where is there to escape to? We can\u2019t escape from the universe. And more important, we can\u2019t escape from our own lives.\n\nAs long as we are fettered by karma, afflicted by weakness, defeated by suffering, and held back by misguided ways of thinking, we\u2019ll never find freedom anywhere.\n\nThe Daishonin says: \u201cNow is the time to break free from the bonds of this realm of birth and death\u201d (WND-2, 333). The practice of the Mystic Law\u2014chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u2014is the sword that severs the chains of delusion that shackle us.\n\nThe life state of Buddhahood brings us true freedom. It is a state of supreme freedom spanning the three existences\u2014past, present, and future\u2014that brims with the power and wisdom to develop our lives as we wish in accord with our determination in faith. The Mystic Law is the ultimate principle for attaining genuine freedom in the real world.\n\nAs the Daishonin states in The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, \u201cThe Thus Come One eternally endowed with the three bodies [the Dharma body, reward body, and manifested body], his [eternal] life span, the distinctions of benefits, the benefits of responding with joy [on hearing the Mystic Law]\u2014all these are matters that pertain to one\u2019s own person. Hence the six sense organs that one received at the time of birth from one\u2019s father and mother are all clean and pure and operate freely and without obstruction\u201d (OTT, 235).\n\nThe Daishonin tells us that all these qualities and benefits he enumerates apply to us. They are taught in the \u201cLife Span\u201d (16th), \u201cDistinctions in Benefits\u201d (17th), \u201cThe Benefits of Responding with Joy\u201d (18th), and \u201cBenefits of the Teacher of the Law\u201d (19th) chapters of the Lotus Sutra.\n\nEach word and phrase of the Lotus Sutra has direct relevance to our lives. The teachings of Nichiren Buddhism are not abstract ideals.\n\nIn particular, the Daishonin states that the six sense organs\u2014namely, sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and consciousness, which we are born with and comprise our physical and mental awareness\u2014are originally pure, free, and unobstructed.\n\nThe purpose of our Buddhist faith and practice is to achieve such a state of untrammeled personal freedom. True and eternal freedom is attained by living aligned and in rhythm with the Mystic Law, by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and sharing it with others.\n\nThis is the way to become an awakened, liberated person, to achieve a free, expansive, unobstructed state of being, and lead a truly unencumbered life in which we can savor the utmost happiness and joy to our heart\u2019s content. That\u2019s why no matter what happens, we must never stop practicing.\n\nThe religious revolution the Soka Gakkai is carrying out is a struggle to liberate humanity, to liberate all people, so that they can enjoy eternal inner freedom.\n\nSuch inner freedom doesn\u2019t come by sitting around and waiting for it; it must be fought for and won. To that end, I ask that each of you strive to gain mastery over yourself. A commitment to self-mastery is the foundation from which everything will follow in accord with the Buddhist principle of \u201cconsistency from beginning to end,\u201d enabling you to create a life of genuine happiness and freedom.\n\nFrom a speech at a nationwide women\u2019s division leaders meeting, Tokyo, April 27, 1988.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 1:\nWhat Is True Happiness? [1.4]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 1:\nWhat Is True Happiness? [1.6]"}, {"title": "chapter-1-6.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 1:\nWhat Is True Happiness? [1.6]\n1.6 The Six Conditions for Happiness\nPresident Ikeda presents six points for attaining happiness in this speech at an SGI general meeting in the U.S.A., and stresses that all of them are included in the practice of Nichiren Buddhism.\nIn his writings, Nichiren Daishonin states, \u201cYou must not spend your lives in vain and regret it for ten thousand years to come\u201d (WND-1, 622).\n\nHow should we live our lives? What is the most valuable and worthwhile way to live? A well-known Japanese poem goes: \u201cThe life of a flower is short / Sufferings only are there many.\u201d*1 The meaning of these lines is that flowers suddenly come into bloom and then, just as suddenly, their petals fall and scatter; ultimately, the only thing that lasts for a long time is suffering. Life, indeed, may be like that in some ways.\n\nA philosopher once remarked that perhaps the only way to determine happiness or unhappiness in life is by adding up, at the end of one\u2019s days, all the joys and all the sorrows one had experienced and basing one\u2019s final evaluation on whichever figure was larger.\n\nDespite having illustrious positions in society or great material wealth, there are many people who fail to become happy. Despite enjoying wonderfully happy marriages or relationships, people must ultimately be parted from the person they love through death. Being separated from loved ones is one of the unavoidable sufferings inherent in the human condition. There are many who, despite gaining great fame and popularity, die after long, agonizing illnesses. Despite being born with exceptional beauty, not a few have been brought to misery by this seeming advantage.\n\nWhere is happiness to be found? How can we become happy? These are fundamental questions of life, and human beings are no doubt destined to pursue them eternally. The teachings of Nichiren Buddhism and faith in the Mystic Law provide fundamental answers to these questions.\n\nUltimately, happiness rests on our establishing a solid sense of self. Happiness based on such externals as possessing a fine house or a good reputation is \u201crelative happiness.\u201d It is not a firm, unchanging \u201cabsolute happiness.\u201d Some might seem to be in the most fortunate circumstances, but if they feel only emptiness and pain, then they cannot be considered happy.\n\nSome people live in truly splendid houses yet do nothing but fight in them. Some people work for famous companies and enjoy a prestige that many envy yet are always being shouted at by their superiors, are left exhausted from heavy workloads, and feel no sense of joy or fulfillment in life.\n\nHappiness does not lie in outward appearances or in vanity. It is a matter of what we feel inside; it is a deep resonance in our lives. I would venture, therefore, that the first condition for happiness is fulfillment.\n\nTo be filled each day with a rewarding sense of exhilaration and purpose, a sense of tasks accomplished and deep fulfillment\u2014people who feel this way are happy. Those who have this sense of satisfaction even if they are extremely busy are much happier than those who have free time on their hands but feel empty inside.\n\nAs practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism, we get up in the morning and do gongyo. Some perhaps may do so rather reluctantly! Nevertheless, doing gongyo is itself a truly great and noble thing. Gongyo is a solemn ceremony in which we are, in a manner of speaking, gazing out across the universe; it is a dialogue with the universe.\n\nDoing gongyo and chanting daimoku before the Gohonzon represent the dawn, the start of a new day, in our lives; it is the sun rising; it gives us a profound sense of contentment in the depths of our being that nothing can surpass. Even on this point alone, we are truly fortunate.\n\nSome people appear to be happy but actually start off the day feeling depressed. A husband might be admonished by his wife in the morning and begin his day dejected, wondering, \u201cHow on earth did I get into such a marriage?\u201d He will savor neither happiness nor contentment. Just by looking at our mornings, it is clear that we in the SGI lead lives of profound worth and satisfaction.\n\nIn addition, each of you is striving to do your best in your job or other responsibilities and to win in all areas of life while using your spare time to work for Buddhism, kosen-rufu, people\u2019s happiness, and the welfare of society. In this Latter Day of the Law teeming with perverse individuals, you are exerting yourselves energetically, often amid many hardships and obstacles, chanting daimoku for others\u2019 happiness, traveling long distances to talk with friends and show them warm concern and understanding. You are truly bodhisattvas. There is no nobler life, no life based on a loftier philosophy. Each of you is translating this unsurpassed philosophy into action and spreading its message far and wide. To possess a philosophy of such profound value is itself the greatest fortune. Accordingly, the second condition for happiness is to possess a profound philosophy.\n\nThe third condition for happiness is to possess conviction. We live in an age in which people can no longer clearly distinguish what is right or wrong, good or evil. This is a global trend. If things continue in this way, humanity is destined for chaos and moral decay. In the midst of such times, you are upholding and earnestly practicing Nichiren Buddhism, a teaching of the highest good.\n\nIn \u201cThe Opening of the Eyes,\u201d the Daishonin writes: \u201cThis I will state. Let the gods forsake me. Let all persecutions assail me. Still I will give my life for the sake of the Law\u201d (WND-1, 280). In this same letter, he instructs his believers not to be swayed by temptations or threats, however great\u2014such as being offered the rulership of Japan or being told that one\u2019s parents will be beheaded (cf. WND-1, 280).\n\nThe important thing is holding on resolutely to one\u2019s convictions, come what may, just as the Daishonin teaches. People who possess such unwavering conviction will definitely become happy. Each of you is such an individual.\n\nThe fourth condition is living cheerfully and vibrantly. Those who are always complaining and grumbling make not only themselves but everyone else around them miserable and unhappy. By contrast, those who always live positively and filled with enthusiasm\u2014those who possess a cheerful and sunny disposition that lifts the spirits and brightens the hearts of everyone they meet\u2014are not only happy themselves but are a source of hope and inspiration for others.\n\nThose who are always wearing long, gloomy expressions whenever you meet them and who have lost the ability to rejoice and feel genuine delight or wonder lead dark, cheerless existences.\n\nOn the other hand, those who possess good cheer can view even a scolding by a loved one, such as a spouse or partner, as sweet music to their ears, or can greet a child\u2019s poor report card as a sign of great potential for improvement! Viewing events and situations in this kind of positive light is important. The strength, wisdom, and cheerfulness that accompany such an attitude lead to happiness.\n\nTo regard everything in a positive light or with a spirit of goodwill, however, does not mean being foolishly gullible and allowing people to take advantage of our good nature. It means having the wisdom and perception to actually move things in a positive direction by seeing things in their best light, while all the time keeping our eyes firmly focused on reality.\n\nFaith and the teachings of Buddhism enable us to develop that kind of character. The acquisition of such character is a more priceless treasure than any other possession in life.\n\nThe fifth condition for happiness is courage. Courageous people can overcome anything. The cowardly, on the other hand, because of their lack of courage, fail to savor the true, profound joys of life. This is most unfortunate.\n\nThe sixth condition for happiness is tolerance. Those who are tolerant and broad-minded make people feel comfortable and at ease. Narrow and intolerant people who berate others for the slightest thing or who make a great commotion each time some problem arises just exhaust and intimidate everyone. Leaders must be tolerant and have a warm approachability that makes people feel relaxed and comfortable. Not only are those who possess a heart as wide as the ocean happy themselves, but all those around them are happy, too.\n\nThe six conditions I have just mentioned are all ultimately encompassed in the single word faith. A life based on faith in the Mystic Law is a life of unsurpassed happiness.\n\nThe Daishonin declares, \u201cNam-myoho-renge-kyo is the greatest of all joys\u201d (OTT, 212). I hope all of you will savor the truth of these words deep in your lives and show vibrant actual proof of that joy.\n\nFrom a speech at an SGI general meeting, U.S.A., June 23, 1996.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1By Japanese author Fumiko Hayashi.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 1:\nWhat Is True Happiness?

[1.7]\n1.7 Confronting Life\u2019s Fundamental Sufferings Head-On\nIn this selection, President Ikeda stresses that the Soka Gakkai and Nichiren Buddhism directly tackle the universal and inescapable issues of birth, aging, sickness, and death, and clarifies that the path to true happiness is to be found in that pursuit.\nWhat is the purpose of life? It is to become happy. What, then, is true happiness? Can fame, wealth, or social status, no matter how immense, bring us true happiness?\n\nSuch things alone do not create lasting happiness at life\u2019s deepest level. Nor can they solve the most fundamental sufferings of existence\u2014birth, aging, sickness, and death. It is for this very reason that Nichiren Daishonin expounded his teaching.\n\nBirth\u2014the pain of being born and of living. There are innumerable sufferings in life. And there is also our karma to deal with. There are accidents that we cannot anticipate. There are such problems as divorce, difficulties with our children, and frustrations at work. The question is how do we overcome all of these and other sufferings?\n\nAging\u2014the suffering of growing older. Right now, you are all young; you are all healthy and possess the beauty of youth. But you will invariably age and grow old. There\u2019s no inoculation against this, and the most expensive medicine will not cure you of old age.\n\nSickness\u2014the suffering of illness. Some suffer from cancer. Others suffer from mental or spiritual illnesses. Life is a battle against myriad diseases and disorders. Second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda often said that there is an illness called poverty, just as there is an illness called meanness of spirit. He also asserted that the karma of being hated by others and ending life in defeat can also be termed a kind of illness. It is the power of the Mystic Law that cures these kinds of illness that afflict the body and mind at a fundamental level.\n\nDeath\u2014this is the most uncompromising of the four sufferings. None of us here today will be alive in 100 years. As the French literary giant Victor Hugo declared: \u201cWe are all under sentence of death but with a sort of indefinite reprieve.\u201d*1\n\nThere are many ways of dying as well. Some die by their own hand, others are murdered. Some suffer unspeakable agony before they die. How should we view our inexorable fate of death? How can we overcome the suffering it causes? These are crucial questions. And what happens after death? Do we still exist? Or is there nothing? If we do exist, in what state do we exist? Such things are beyond ordinary human understanding.\n\nThe sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death are universal to humankind. They are the basic issues we face in our unending search for happiness. Yet almost all of society\u2019s leaders sidestep them. They furtively avert their eyes from the very issues that any leader who feels a sense of responsibility for the welfare of the people cannot possibly neglect. This is a great misfortune for the people.\n\nThe Soka Gakkai confronts these fundamental problems head-on. And Nichiren Daishonin reveals the means for resolving them completely.\n\nHe elucidates the Mystic Law, which enables us to serenely overcome the four sufferings and all other kinds of hardships and obstacles, and in fact even use our sufferings as an impetus to propel us forward as we lead lives pervaded by the four virtues of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity.\n\nLife is a struggle. Reality is a struggle. Nichiren Daishonin teaches that Buddhism is about winning. He exhorts us to be victorious. So we must win in life. To embrace the Mystic Law is to grasp the sword of victory. We can triumph over all. We can triumph and enjoy our lives. A \u201cperson of faith\u201d is synonymous with \u201ca person of victory.\u201d\n\nTherefore, I hope all of you will be victorious in your lives. Live your lives so that you can declare: \u201cI have no regrets. I enjoyed my life. I encouraged many others and gave them hope. It was a good life.\u201d\n\nFrom a speech at an SGI-USA youth division general meeting, U.S.A., March 14, 1993.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Walter Pater, The Renaissance (New York: Random House, 1873), p. 198.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 1:\nWhat Is True Happiness?

When we reveal that life state, our perspective is transformed and we can build a state of unimpeded, absolute happiness. This chapter presents President Ikeda\u2019s teachings concerning that inner transformation.\n\nIn this selection, he explains how those who embrace the Mystic Law can lead lives of optimism, in which life is in itself a joyous experience.\nLet\u2019s lead vibrant, enjoyable lives. We have the Gohonzon. We have the Mystic Law. That means that each of us is an embodiment of the Mystic Law, an embodiment of infinite good fortune, and a majestic treasure tower. As a result, we will not be defeated; we have nothing to fear.\n\nWhen we firmly believe that our life is the treasure tower and that we each embody Buddhahood, we come to find life itself enjoyable and pleasant. Attaining and savoring such a wonderful state of mind is the purpose of our Buddhist faith and practice.\n\nThose who live their lives in the realm of the Soka Gakkai, in the realm of kosen-rufu, will enjoy such a joy-filled state of life eternally, throughout the three existences of past, present, and future.\n\nDo we live our lives as optimists or pessimists?\n\nPessimists focus on the sad, painful, gloomy side of things. \u201cWhat will I do if my husband dies?\u201d \u201cWhat will I do if my wife falls ill?\u201d \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t achieve my goals?\u201d \u201cWhat if my daughter falls in love with someone who is no good for her?\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re always thinking pessimistic thoughts, pessimism will taint your mind. You will never be able to be happy. If you\u2019re always seeing things in a negative, gloomy light, bemoaning your situation and worrying\u2014\u201cI never have any money,\u201d \u201cOh, no, another meeting!\u201d or \u201cWhat if I\u2019m scolded again today?\u201d\u2014then life will be nothing but a painful austerity!\n\nOn the other hand, you can look at the bright side of everything. You can take what happens and view it in a positive, hopeful, and cheerful light. This is optimism, the ultimate form of which is faith in the Mystic Law. For example, if you get sick, you can say: \u201cNow I can get some rest! It\u2019ll give me a chance to ponder the three existences!\u201d And with hope in your heart you can declare that you won\u2019t let this sickness defeat you, that you will survive it, and thus vanquish the \u201cdevil of illness.\u201d\n\nOptimists are strong. They see the positive in everything and decide to make it a reality for all to see.\n\nI hope you will live with optimism, remaining undefeated by whatever happens in life, transforming hardship into joy, and laughing off adversity like the famous comic actor Charlie Chaplin.\n\nFrom a speech at an SGI-Canada Vancouver general meeting, Canada, October 1, 1993.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 1:\nWhat Is True Happiness?

This is why the Soka Gakkai movement, which embraces the philosophy that \u201cIt is the heart that is important\u201d and seeks to transform our lives, is the fundamental path to happiness.\nWe may encounter all kinds of problems in the course of life. There will also undoubtedly be times when we are faced with circumstances beyond our control. But why is it that, in the same situation, one person advances vibrantly, while another sorrows and laments? It is because happiness is an internal condition, something we feel in our hearts.\n\nIf we can live our lives with joy, if we enjoy living, then we are winners. That\u2019s why transforming our hearts and minds is so important. This is the essence of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nExternal appearances are not what matters. There are many people whose circumstances are the envy of others, but who are actually very unhappy. Those with strong, wise, resilient, and generous hearts remain upbeat and positive, no matter what happens.\n\n\u201cIt is the heart that is important\u201d (WND-1, 1000), writes the Daishonin. This is the foundation for happiness\u2014a foundation we establish through the Mystic Law.\n\nThe Daishonin declares: \u201cThe wonderful means of truly putting an end to the physical and spiritual obstacles of all living beings is none other than Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u201d (WND-1, 842).\n\nHappiness is not just a word. It is not found in objects, nor is it determined by wealth, social status, or celebrity.\n\nThe key, first of all, is to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. When we do so, we will feel an upsurge of life force.\n\nTo feel joy in the depths of our lives, no matter what happens, to take delight in each moment of each day as we converse with friends and chant to our heart\u2019s content\u2014these are examples of genuine happiness.\n\nOur Soka Gakkai movement teaches the fundamental way to achieve such happiness.\n\nIf we live out our lives based on faith in the Mystic Law, we will experience joy in both life and death.

Lies and deceit abound in society. It is foolish to allow ourselves to be swayed by such things; it only leads to unhappiness. The Mystic Law and Nichiren Daishonin are absolutely free of any falsehood. The wisest possible course, therefore, is to dedicate our lives to the widespread propagation of the Law\u2014to kosen-rufu.\n\nOn account of our faith in Nichiren Buddhism, we may from time to time encounter unpleasantness from others. We may also find ourselves working much harder than many around us. But that is all part of our Buddhist practice.\n\nThe Daishonin teaches that we can attain enlightenment in this lifetime. This entails weathering the trials of the three obstacles and four devils.*1 But if we can do that, we can attain enlightenment in this lifetime and enjoy the boundless life state of Buddhahood throughout eternity. That\u2019s why we need to forge ahead fearlessly, positively, and courageously, come what may.\n\nThe second characteristic is living with vibrant hope. Nothing is stronger than hope. The Mystic Law is a source of eternal hope. People who never lose hope, no matter what happens, are truly happy.\n\nThe third characteristic is a state of life in which we savor joy at all times. It is to have such joy that, even at the time of death, one can say with a heartfelt smile: \u201cWhat a wonderful life that was! Now where shall I go next?\u201d That is the life state of a genuine practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nOur Buddhist practice enables us to achieve an expansive state of being in which we can enjoy everything in life. As the Daishonin says, faith in the Mystic Law is \u201cthe greatest of all joys\u201d (OTT, 212).\n\nFrom a speech at a Chubu Region representatives conference, Aichi, May 26, 1997.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Three obstacles and four devils: Various obstacles and hindrances to the practice of Buddhism. The three obstacles are (1) the obstacle of earthly desires, (2) the obstacle of karma, and (3) the obstacle of retribution. The four devils are (1) the hindrance of the five components, (2) the hindrance of earthly desires, (3) the hindrance of death, and (4) the hindrance of the devil king.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 2:\nDeveloping a Life State of Happiness [2.2]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 2:\nDeveloping a Life State of Happiness [2.4]"}, {"title": "chapter-2-4.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 2:\nDeveloping a Life State of Happiness [2.4]\n2.4 Our Happiness Is Determined by Our Inner Life Condition\nHappiness is not determined by our circumstances, but is something each of us creates for ourselves through our inner life condition. Nichiren Buddhism teaches the way to elevate that life condition.\nThe English poet John Milton wrote: \u201cThe mind is its own place, and in itself \u2018Can make a Heav\u2019n of Hell, a Hell of Heav\u2019n.\u2019\u201d*1 This statement, a product of the poet\u2019s profound insight, resonates with the Buddhist teaching of \u201cthree thousand realms in a single moment of life.\u201d*2\n\nHow we see the world and feel about our lives is determined solely by our inner life condition. Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cHungry spirits perceive the Ganges River as fire, human beings perceive it as water, and heavenly beings perceive it as amrita*3. Though the water is the same, it appears differently according to one\u2019s karmic reward from the past\u201d (WND-1, 486).\n\n\u201cKarmic reward from the past\u201d refers to our present life state, which is the result of past actions or causes created through our own words, thoughts, and deeds. That state of life determines our view of and feelings toward the external world.\n\nThe same circumstances may be perceived as utter bliss by one person and unbearable misfortune by another. And while some people may love the place where they live, thinking it\u2019s the best place ever, others may hate it and constantly seek to find happiness somewhere else.\n\nNichiren Buddhism is a teaching that enables us to elevate our inner state of life, realizing genuinely happy lives for ourselves as well as prosperity for society. It is the great teaching of the \u201cactual three thousand realms in a single moment of life,\u201d*4 making it possible for us to transform the place where we dwell into the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light.*5\n\nMoreover, the good fortune, benefit, and joy we gain through living in accord with the eternal Law [of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo] are not temporary. In the same way that trees steadily add growth rings with each passing year, our lives accumulate good fortune that will endure throughout the three existences of past, present, and future. In contrast, worldly wealth and fame as well as various amusements and pleasures\u2014no matter how glamorous or exciting they may seem for a time\u2014are fleeting and insubstantial.\n\nFrom a speech at a Wakayama Prefecture general meeting, Wakayama, March 24, 1988.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1John Milton, Paradise Lost, edited by Christopher Ricks (London: Penguin Books, 1989), p. 12.\n*2Three thousand realms in a single moment of life: A philosophical system established by the Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai of China based on the Lotus Sutra. The \u201cthree thousand realms\u201d indicates the varying aspects that life assumes at each moment. At each moment, life manifests one of the Ten Worlds. Each of these worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself, thus making one hundred possible worlds. Each of these hundred worlds possesses the ten factors and operates within each of the three realms of existence, thus making three thousand realms. In other words, all phenomena are contained within a single moment of life, and a single moment of life permeates the three thousand realms of existence, or the entire phenomenal world.\n*3Amrita: A legendary, ambrosia-like liquid. In ancient India, it was regarded as the sweet-tasting beverage of the gods. In China, it was thought to rain down from heaven when the world became peaceful. Amrita is said to remove sufferings and give immortality. The word amrita means immortality and is often translated as sweet dew.\n*4Actual three thousand realms in a single moment of life: The doctrine of three thousand realms in a single moment of life, which is the fundamental teaching for attaining enlightenment, is classified into two as the theoretical principle and the actual embodiment of this principle. These are respectively termed \u201ctheoretical three thousand realms in a single moment of life\u201d and \u201cactual three thousand realms in a single moment of life.\u201d The theoretical principle is based on the theoretical teaching (first half) of the Lotus Sutra, while the actual principle is revealed in the essential teaching (latter half) of the Lotus Sutra. However, in the Latter Day of the Law, these are both theoretical; and the Law of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo that Nichiren Daishonin revealed is the actual teaching of three thousand realms in a single moment of life.\n*5Land of Eternally Tranquil Light: Also, Land of Tranquil Light. The Buddha land, which is free from impermanence and impurity. In many sutras, the actual saha world in which human beings dwell is described as an impure land filled with delusions and sufferings, while the Buddha land is described as a pure land free from these and far removed from this saha world. In contrast, the Lotus Sutra reveals the saha world to be the Buddha land, or the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light, and explains that the nature of a land is determined by the minds of its inhabitants\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 2:\nDeveloping a Life State of Happiness [2.3]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 2:\nDeveloping a Life State of Happiness [2.5]"}, {"title": "chapter-2-5.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 2:\nDeveloping a Life State of Happiness [2.5]\n2.5 Happiness Is Found Where We Are\nThe writings of Nichiren Daishonin show us we can build a state of unshakable happiness in our own lives here and now.\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, Nichiren Daishonin explains the following passage from the \u201cEncouragements of the Bodhisattva Universal Worthy\u201d chapter of the Lotus Sutra, \u201cBefore long this person will proceed to the place of enlightenment\u201d (LSOC28, 364), stating:\n\n\u201cThe words \u2018this person\u2019 refer to the practitioner of the Lotus Sutra. The place where the person upholds and honors the Lotus Sutra is the \u2018place of enlightenment\u2019 to which the person proceeds. It is not that he leaves his present place and goes to some other place. The \u2018place of enlightenment\u2019 is the place where the living beings of the Ten Worlds*1 reside. And now the place where Nichiren and his followers chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, \u2018whether . . . in mountain valleys or the wide wilderness\u2019 [LSOC21, 316], these places are all the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light. This is what is meant by the \u2018place of enlightenment.\u2019\u201d (cf. OTT, 192)*2\n\n\u201cThis person\u201d refers to the practitioner, or votary, of the Lotus Sutra. In the specific sense, it indicates Nichiren Daishonin himself, while in the more general sense, it refers to all people who embrace and practice Nam-myoho-renge-kyo of the Three Great Secret Laws. The place where people embrace and practice the correct teaching of Buddhism is the \u201c\u2018place of enlightenment\u2019 to which the person proceeds,\u201d in other words, the place where we strive to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime.\n\nThere is no need to leave this trouble-filled saha world for some otherworldly pure land or ideal paradise. The \u201cplace of enlightenment\u201d is none other than the dwelling place of living beings of the Ten Worlds. Now, the place where Nichiren Daishonin and his disciples who chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo reside is the land of Eternally Tranquil Light, or the Buddha land, whether it be \u201cin mountain valleys or the wide wilderness\u201d (LSOC21, 316). It is the \u201cplace of enlightenment,\u201d the Daishonin asserts. The place where each practitioner lives becomes the Land of Tranquil Light. This passage alludes to the profound transformative power inherent in a single life-moment.\n\nPeople often tend to think of happiness as something abstract and removed from their present realities. They imagine, for example, that they would be happier if they could move to another place, or that they would enjoy more comfortable and pleasant lives if they could change jobs. They always feel that the grass is greener on the other side and place their hopes on a change of external circumstances. Young people are particularly susceptible to this tendency.\n\nHowever, we all have different missions to fulfill in life and different places where we need to live to fulfill them. Those who decide to put down solid roots where they are and continue to live their lives with perseverance and hope while struggling with reality will be victors in life. It\u2019s important not to live aimlessly, lacking any clear purpose. I therefore say to you: \u201cDig beneath your feet, there you will find a spring,\u201d and \u201cLive in a way that is true to yourself.\u201d\n\nIn short, a real sense of happiness and deep satisfaction in life can only be found within us. The Mystic Law is the fundamental law of life. Through our Buddhist practice, we can tap the power of the Mystic Law to propel our lives forward. This is why the place where we carry out our Buddhist practice and also society become the Buddha land. We are able to transform where we live right now into a place of victory and happiness.\n\nFrom a speech at a university groups and Toshima Ward joint training session, Tokyo, December 7, 1986.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Ten Worlds: The realms of hell, hungry spirits, animals, asuras, human beings, heavenly beings, voice-hearers, cause-awakened ones, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas. They are also referred to as the ten life states of hell, hunger, animality, anger, humanity, heaven, learning, realization, bodhisattva, and Buddhahood.\n*2This translation of The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings has been updated to reflect a revised English translation of the Lotus Sutra as it appears in The Lotus Sutra and Its Opening and Closing Sutras.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 2:\nDeveloping a Life State of Happiness [2.4]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 2:\nDeveloping a Life State of Happiness [2.6]"}, {"title": "chapter-2-6.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 2:\nDeveloping a Life State of Happiness [2.6]\n2.6 Activating the Limitless Life Force of Buddhahood\nPresident Ikeda explains the nature of the world of Buddhahood, the highest life state of the Buddhist analysis of life articulated in the principle of the mutual possession of the Ten Worlds, and how we can manifest it.\nLife, which is constantly changing from moment to moment, can be broadly categorized into ten states, which Buddhism articulates as the Ten Worlds. These consist of the six paths\u2014the worlds of hell, hungry spirits, animals, asuras, human beings, and heavenly beings\u2014and the four noble worlds\u2014the worlds of voice-hearers, cause-awakened ones, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas. The true reality of life is that it always possesses all ten of these potential states.\n\nNone of the Ten Worlds that appear in our lives at any given moment remain fixed or constant. They change instant by instant. Buddhism\u2019s deep insight into this dynamic nature of life is expressed as the principle of the \u201cmutual possession of the Ten Worlds.\u201d*1\n\nIn his treatise \u201cThe Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind,\u201d Nichiren Daishonin illustrates clearly and simply how the world of human beings, or life state of humanity, contains within it the other nine worlds:\n\n\u201cWhen we look from time to time at a person\u2019s face, we find him or her sometimes joyful, sometimes enraged, and sometimes calm. At times greed appears in the person\u2019s face, at times foolishness, and at times perversity. Rage is the world of hell, greed is that of hungry spirits, foolishness is that of animals, perversity is that of asuras, joy is that of heaven [heavenly beings], and calmness is that of human beings.\u201d (WND-1, 358)\n\nThe nine worlds are continually emerging and becoming dormant within us. This is something that we can see, sense, and recognize in our own daily lives.\n\nIt is important to note here that the teachings of Buddhism from the very beginning were always concerned with enabling people to manifest the noble and infinitely powerful life state of Buddhahood. And, indeed, that should always be the purpose of Buddhist practice. Focusing on this point, the great teaching of Nichiren Daishonin, by establishing the correct object of devotion [the Gohonzon of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo], sets forth a practical means for revealing our inner Buddhahood. As such, Nichiren Buddhism is a practice open to all people.\n\nA look at history to this day shows that humanity is still trapped in the cycle of the six paths, or lower six worlds. The character for \u201cearth\u201d (ji) is contained in the Japanese word for \u201chell\u201d (jigoku; lit. earth prison), imparting the meaning of being bound or shackled to something of the lowest or basest level. Humanity and society can never achieve substantial revitalization unless people give serious thought to casting off the shackles of these lower worlds and elevating their state of life. Even in the midst of this troubled and corrupt world, Buddhism discovers in human life the highest and most dignified potential of Buddhahood.\n\nThough our lives may constantly move through the six paths, we can activate the limitless life force of Buddhahood by focusing our minds on the correct object of devotion and achieving the \u201cfusion of reality and wisdom.\u201d*2\n\nBuddhahood is difficult to describe in words. Unlike the other nine worlds, it has no concrete expression. It is the ultimate function of life that moves the nine worlds in the direction of boundless value.\n\nEven on cloudy or rainy days, by the time a plane reaches an altitude of about 10,000 meters [33,000 feet] it is flying high above the clouds amid bright sunshine and can proceed smoothly on its course. In the same way, no matter how painful or difficult our daily existence may be, if we make the sun in our hearts shine brightly, we can overcome all adversity with calm composure. That inner sun is the life state of Buddhahood.\n\nIn one sense, as the Daishonin states in The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings: \u201c\u2018Bodhisattva\u2019 is a preliminary step toward the attainment of the effect of Buddhahood\u201d (OTT, 87). The world of bodhisattvas is characterized by taking action for the sake of the Law, people, and society. Without such bodhisattva practice as our foundation, we cannot attain Buddhahood. Buddhahood is not something realized simply through conceptual understanding. Even reading countless Buddhist scriptures or books on Buddhism will not lead one to true enlightenment.\n\nIn addition, attaining Buddhahood doesn\u2019t mean that we become someone different. We remain who we are, living out our lives in the reality of society, where the nine worlds\u2014especially the six paths\u2014prevail. A genuine Buddhist philosophy does not present enlightenment or Buddhas as something mysterious or otherworldly.\n\nWhat is important for us as human beings is to elevate our lives from a lower to a higher state, to expand our lives from a closed, narrow state of life to one that is infinitely vast and encompassing. Buddhahood represents the supreme state of life.\n\nFrom On Life and Buddhism, published in Japanese in November 1986.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Mutual possession of the Ten Worlds: The principle that each of the Ten Worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself. \u201cMutual possession\u201d means that life is not fixed in one or another of the Ten Worlds, but can manifest any of the ten\u2014from hell to Buddhahood\u2014at any given moment. The important point of this principle is that all beings in any of the nine worlds possess the Buddha nature. This means that every person has the potential to manifest Buddhahood, while a Buddha also possesses the nine worlds and in this sense is not separate or different from ordinary people.\n*2Fusion of reality and wisdom: The fusion of the objective reality or truth and the subjective wisdom to realize that truth, which is the Buddha nature inherent within one\u2019s life.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 2:\nDeveloping a Life State of Happiness [2.5]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 2:\nDeveloping a Life State of Happiness [2.7]"}, {"title": "chapter-2-7.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 2:\nDeveloping a Life State of Happiness [2.7]\n2.7 Establishing Buddhahood as Our Basic Life Tendency\nIn this selection, President Ikeda explains that in Nichiren Buddhism, Buddhahood is not something we hope to achieve after death, but is instead an open and manifest life state that we can achieve within our lives as we are.\nOne way to view the principle that each of us is an entity of the mutual possession of the Ten Worlds*1 is to look at it from the perspective of our basic life tendency. While we all possess the Ten Worlds, our lives often lean toward one particular life state more than others\u2014for instance, some people\u2019s lives are basically inclined toward the life state of hell, while others tend naturally toward the state of bodhisattva. This could be called the \u201chabit pattern\u201d of one\u2019s life, a predisposition formed through karmic causes that a person has accumulated from the past.\n\nJust as a spring returns to its original shape after being stretched, people tend to revert to their own basic tendency. But even if one\u2019s basic life tendency is the life state of hell, it doesn\u2019t mean that one will remain in that state 24 hours a day. That person will still move from one life state to another\u2014for instance, sometimes manifesting that of humanity, sometimes that of anger, and so on. Likewise, those whose basic life tendency is anger\u2014driven by the desire to always be better than others\u2014will also sometimes manifest higher life states such as heaven or bodhisattva. However, even if they momentarily manifest the state of bodhisattva, they will quickly revert to their basic life tendency of anger.\n\nChanging our basic life tendency means carrying out our human revolution and fundamentally transforming our state of life. It means changing our mind-set or resolve on the deepest level. The kind of life we live is decided by our basic life tendency. For example, those whose basic life tendency is hunger are as though on board a ship called Hunger. While sailing ahead in the state of hunger, they will sometimes experience joy and sometimes suffering. Though there are various ups and downs, the ship unerringly proceeds on its set course. Consequently, for those on board this ship, everything they see will be colored by the hues of hunger. And even after they die, their lives will merge with the realm of hunger inherent in the universe.\n\nEstablishing the state of Buddhahood as our basic life tendency is what it means to \u201cattain Buddhahood.\u201d Of course, even with Buddhahood as our basic life tendency, we won\u2019t be free of problems or suffering because we will still possess the other nine worlds. But the foundation of our lives will become one of hope, and we will increasingly experience a condition of security and joy.\n\nMy mentor, Josei Toda, once explained this as follows:\n\n\u201cEven if you fall ill, simply have the attitude, \u2018I\u2019m all right. I know that if I chant to the Gohonzon, I will get well.\u2019 Isn\u2019t the world of Buddhahood a state of life in which we can live with total peace of mind? That said, however, given that the nine worlds are inherent in the world of Buddhahood, we might still occasionally become angry or have to deal with problems. Therefore, enjoying total peace of mind doesn\u2019t mean that we have to renounce anger or some such thing. When something worrying happens, it\u2019s only natural to be worried. But in the innermost depths of our lives, we will have a profound sense of security. This is what it means to be a Buddha. . . .\n\n\u201cIf we can regard life itself as an absolute joy, isn\u2019t that being a Buddha? Doesn\u2019t that mean attaining the same life state as the Daishonin? Even when faced with the threat of being beheaded, the Daishonin remained calm and composed. If it had been us in that situation, we\u2019d have been in a state of complete panic! When the Daishonin was exiled to the hostile environment of Sado Island, he continued instructing his disciples on various matters and produced such important writings as \u2018The Opening of the Eyes\u2019 and \u2018The Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind.\u2019 If he didn\u2019t have unshakable peace of mind, he would never have been able to compose such great treatises [under such difficult circumstances].\u201d*2\n\nOur daily practice of gongyo\u2014reciting portions of the Lotus Sutra and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u2014is a solemn ceremony in which our lives become one with the life of the Buddha. By applying ourselves steadfastly and persistently to this practice for manifesting our inherent Buddhahood, we firmly establish the life state of Buddhahood in our lives so that it is solid and unshakable like the earth. On this foundation, this solid stage, we can freely enact at each moment the drama of the nine worlds.\n\nMoreover, kosen-rufu is the challenge to transform the fundamental life state of society into that of Buddhahood. The key to this lies in increasing the number of those who share our noble aspirations.\n\nWhen we base ourselves on faith in Nichiren Buddhism, absolutely no effort we make is ever wasted. When we establish Buddhahood as our basic life tendency, we can move toward a future of hope while creating positive value from all our activities in the nine worlds, both past and present. In fact, all of our hardships and struggles in the nine worlds become the nourishment that strengthens the world of Buddhahood in our lives.\n\nIn accord with the Buddhist principle that \u201cearthly desires lead to enlightenment,\u201d sufferings (earthly desires, or the deluded impulses of the nine worlds) all become the \u201cfirewood\u201d or fuel for gaining happiness (enlightenment, or the world of Buddhahood). This is similar to how our bodies digest food and turn it into energy.\n\nA Buddha who has no connection to the actual sufferings of the nine worlds is not a genuine Buddha\u2014namely, one who embodies the mutual possession of the Ten Worlds. This is the essential message of the \u201cLife Span\u201d (16th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra.\n\nThe world of Buddhahood can also be described as a state of life where one willingly takes on even hellish suffering. This is the world of hell contained in the world of Buddhahood. It is characterized by empathy and hardships deliberately taken on for the happiness and welfare of others, and arises from a sense of responsibility and compassion. Courageously taking on problems and sufferings for the sake of others strengthens the world of Buddhahood in our lives.\n\n*****\n\nBecause of the principle of the \u201cmutual possession of the Ten Worlds,\u201d our Buddhist practice enables us to live true to ourselves. Buddhist teachings that lack this principle reject the nine worlds, seeking to reach the state of Buddhahood by breaking free of these lower states. But this approach actually detracts from one\u2019s humanity. It means a life of prohibitions and proscriptions, of constant fault-finding and self-negation, and leads ultimately to \u201creducing the body to ashes and annihilating consciousness.\u201d*3 Of course, self-reflection and self-control are important, but taken to the extreme they can turn one into a rigid, narrow-minded person who barely knows what it means to be alive.\n\nThis may be a case of the remedy being worse than the disease. A better approach more often is to overlook people\u2019s minor shortcomings, and instead give them hope and purpose so they can move forward positively. By living in this way with vibrant self-confidence, a person\u2019s faults will naturally recede and transform. For instance, the fault of impatience might turn into the virtue of energetic action.\n\nThis is true of our own lives, and applies to fostering others as well. The key is to be true to oneself, without trying to impress others or to be something we\u2019re not. We\u2019re all human; at times we laugh, at times we cry. We get angry, and we become confused.\n\nAs ordinary people, just as we are, when we commit ourselves on the deepest level to kosen-rufu, the state of Buddhahood becomes our basic life tendency.\n\nWe should allow ourselves to be angry when anger is called for, to worry when there is something we need to worry about, to laugh when something is funny, and to enjoy what is enjoyable. The Daishonin says: \u201cSuffer what there is to suffer, enjoy what there is to enjoy\u201d (WND-1, 681). Living this way each day, with vitality and joy, we move dynamically toward the goal of absolute happiness for ourselves and others.\n\nFrom The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra, vol. 4, published in Japanese in December 1998.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Mutual possession of the Ten Worlds: The principle that each of the Ten Worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself. \u201cMutual possession\u201d means that life is not fixed in one or another of the Ten Worlds, but can manifest any of the ten\u2014from hell to Buddhahood\u2014at any given moment.

This means that every person has the potential to manifest Buddhahood, while a Buddha also possesses the nine worlds and in this sense is not separate or different from ordinary people.\n*2Translated from Japanese.

In this excerpt from The New Human Revolution, Shin\u2019ichi as Soka Gakkai president gives guidance at an informal meeting with members during a visit to Mie Prefecture in April 1978. He stresses that each individual is a noble Buddha with an incredibly precious mission.\nThe Soka Gakkai is a realm of faith. It starts and ends with faith. The key is to look at everything through the eyes of faith.\n\nWhat is faith? It is having absolute conviction that all things are part of your own life and being, that you embody the Mystic Law and are a Buddha. Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cYou must never think that any of the eighty thousand sacred teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha\u2019s lifetime or any of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions and three existences are outside yourself\u201d (WND-1, 3).\n\nBelieve that the boundless life state of Buddhahood resides within you, earnestly chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, and polish your life\u2014this, the Daishonin teaches, is the only way to free ourselves from suffering and delusion. You are all originally Buddhas. Believe in yourself. There\u2019s no need to compare yourself to others and let that determine your happiness.\n\nThe path to establishing an indestructible state of absolute happiness exists nowhere but in polishing your own life and bringing forth the Buddha nature inside you.\n\nIf you can\u2019t believe you embody the Mystic Law, you\u2019ll never have self-confidence in the truest sense of the word, and you\u2019ll always be searching for the path to happiness outside yourself.\n\nWhat happens then? You\u2019ll end up being swayed by people\u2019s opinions and other external circumstances, happy one minute and sad the next. You\u2019ll compare yourself to others in all areas\u2014social status or position, economic standing, personality, looks, and so on. When you think you\u2019re a bit better than someone, you\u2019ll feel superior. You\u2019ll become conceited, unable to see yourself objectively. But the moment you think you\u2019re lacking, you\u2019ll feel depressed, worthless, and powerless.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re too concerned about what others think of you, you\u2019ll be hurt and offended by even the most inconsequential words or actions. You\u2019ll hate and resent these people for saying something \u201cterrible\u201d about you, not appreciating you, or showing no compassion.\n\nSome people worry so much about others\u2019 opinions that they\u2019ll go to any lengths to win their favor.\n\nThe fundamental cause of resentment is being deluded about the true nature of your life. Unable, though you practice Nichiren Buddhism, to really believe you are a treasure tower and a Buddha, you seek happiness outside. This provides an opening for devilish influences.\n\nYou are all magnificent, noble Buddhas. You are people with an incredibly precious mission. Don\u2019t compare yourselves to others. Value and accept yourselves for who you are and always strive to develop your own unique potential.\n\nAnd just as each one of you is a Buddha, so is everyone else around you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to respect and treasure your fellow members to the utmost. That is the key to the unity of the Soka Gakkai.\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, volume 29, \u201cRikiso\u201d (Sprinting Forward) chapter.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 2:\nDeveloping a Life State of Happiness [2.7]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.1]"}, {"title": "chapter-3-1.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.1]\n3.1 The Gohonzon\u2014the Fundamental Object of Devotion\nNichiren Buddhism teaches the importance of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with faith in the Gohonzon in order to transform our lives and manifest the life state of Buddhahood. Here, President Ikeda explains the meaning of the Gohonzon as the fundamental object of devotion.\nThe Japanese word honzon means \u201cobject of fundamental respect or devotion\u201d\u2014in other words, the object that we respect and devote ourselves to as the basis of our lives. It is only natural, therefore, that what we take as our object of devotion will have a decisive impact on the direction of our lives.\n\nTraditionally, objects of devotion in Buddhism were often statues of the Buddha. In some cases, paintings of the Buddha were used. While statues of the Buddha did not exist in early Buddhism, they later began to appear in the Gandhara region of northwest India, due to the influence of Hellenic culture. They were, if you like, a product of cultural exchange on the ancient Silk Road. Through statues and paintings, people became familiar with the image of the Buddha, leading them to arouse faith in the Buddha and revere him.\n\nThe object of devotion in Nichiren Buddhism, however, is the Gohonzon,*1 which consists of written characters. In that sense, rather than simply a visual or graphic depiction, I would call it the highest and noblest expression of the world of the intellect, of the great wisdom of the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law. In this respect alone, Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s object of devotion is fundamentally different from those traditionally worshipped in Buddhism.\n\nWritten words are wondrous; they have tremendous power. Take people\u2019s names, for example. When people sign their names, it embodies everything about them\u2014their character, social position, power, emotional and physical condition, personal history, and karma.\n\nSimilarly, the daimoku of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo [which is inscribed down the center of the Gohonzon] encompasses all things in the universe. All phenomena are expressions of the Mystic Law, as the Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai indicates when he states [in Great Concentration and Insight]: \u201cArising is the arising of the essential nature of the Law [Dharma nature], and extinction is the extinction of that nature\u201d (WND-1, 216).\n\nThe true aspect of the ever-changing universe (all phenomena) is perfectly expressed, just as it is, in the Gohonzon. The true aspect of the macrocosm of the universe is exactly the same for the microcosm of each of our lives. This is what the Daishonin tells us in his writings. In addition, the Gohonzon expresses the enlightened life state of Nichiren Daishonin, the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law.\n\nIn that sense, the Gohonzon inscribed by the Daishonin is an embodiment of the fundamental law of the universe that should be revered by all people; it is the true object of fundamental devotion.\n\nThe universe contains both positive and negative workings or functions. Representatives of the Ten Worlds*2 are all depicted on the Gohonzon\u2014from the Buddhas Shakyamuni and Many Treasures, who represent the world of Buddhahood, to Devadatta, who represents the world of hell. The Daishonin teaches that such representatives of the positive and negative workings of the universe are all without exception illuminated by the light of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, enabling them to display \u201cthe dignified attributes that they inherently possess,\u201d and that this is the function of the Gohonzon (cf. WND-1, 832).\n\nWhen we do gongyo and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo before the Gohonzon, both the positive and negative tendencies in our lives begin to manifest \u201cthe dignified attributes that they inherently possess.\u201d The world of hell with its painful suffering, the world of hungry spirits with its insatiable cravings, the world of asuras with its perverse rage\u2014all come to function to contribute to our happiness and to the creation of value. When we base our lives on the Mystic Law, the life states that drag us toward suffering and unhappiness move in the opposite, positive direction. It is as if sufferings become the \u201cfirewood\u201d that fuels the flames of joy, wisdom, and compassion. The Mystic Law and faith are what ignite those flames.\n\nIn addition, when we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the positive forces of the universe\u2014represented by all Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and heavenly deities such as Brahma and Shakra [the protective gods of Buddhism]\u2014will shine even more brightly, their power and influence increasing and expanding endlessly. The gods of the sun and moon that exist in the microcosm of our lives will also shine brilliantly to illuminate the darkness within. All of the workings\u2014both positive and negative\u2014of the Ten Worlds and the three thousand realms*3 function together at full power, propelling us toward a life of happiness, a life imbued with the four virtues of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity.\n\nIn life, it is only natural that we sometimes fall ill. Based on the teaching of the Mystic Law, however, we can look at illness as an inherent part of life. Seeing it this way, we will not be swayed by illness when it happens to us, or allow it to be a source of suffering and distress. Viewed from the perspective of the eternity of life, we are definitely on the way to establishing a \u201cgreater self\u201d overflowing with absolute happiness. In addition, we will be able to overcome any obstacle we encounter in life, using it as a springboard for developing a new, more expansive state of being. Life will be enjoyable, and death will be peaceful, marking the solemn departure for our next wonderful lifetime.\n\nWhen winter arrives, trees are, for a while, bare of flowers and leaves. But they possess the life force to grow fresh green leaves when spring comes. Similar to this, but on an even more profound level, for us, as practitioners of the Mystic Law, death is the dynamic process by which our life itself transitions, without pain, to quickly begin its next mission-filled existence.\n\nFrom a speech at an SGI-USA youth training session, U.S.A., February 20, 1990.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1The word Gohonzon is formed in Japanese by appending the honorific prefix go to the word honzon, object of fundamental respect or devotion.\n*2Ten Worlds: The realms of hell, hungry spirits, animals, asuras, human beings, heavenly beings, voice-hearers, cause-awakened ones, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas. They are also referred to as the ten life states of hell, hunger, animality, anger, humanity, heaven, learning, realization, bodhisattva, and Buddhahood.\n*3Three thousand realms in a single moment of life: A philosophical system established by the Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai of China based on the Lotus Sutra. The \u201cthree thousand realms\u201d indicates the varying aspects that life assumes at each moment. At each moment, life manifests one of the Ten Worlds. Each of these worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself, thus making one hundred possible worlds. Each of these hundred worlds possesses the ten factors and operates within each of the three realms of existence, thus making three thousand realms. In other words, all phenomena are contained within a single moment of life, and a single moment of life permeates the three thousand realms of existence, or the entire phenomenal world.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 2:\nDeveloping a Life State of Happiness [2.8]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.2]"}, {"title": "chapter-3-2.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.2]\n3.2 \u201cNever Seek This Gohonzon outside Yourself\u201d\nIn this selection, President Ikeda explains the profound principle of tapping the power of the Gohonzon in our lives. The immeasurable life force and limitless wisdom expressed by the Gohonzon are also inherent in our lives, and our Buddhist faith and practice enable us to exercise them with unrestricted freedom.\nIn any religion, the object of worship or devotion holds a place of prime importance. What, then, is the true meaning of the object of devotion, or the Gohonzon, in Nichiren Buddhism?\n\nIn \u201cThe Real Aspect of the Gohonzon,\u201d the Daishonin states: \u201cNever seek this Gohonzon outside yourself. The Gohonzon exists only within the mortal flesh of us ordinary people who embrace the Lotus Sutra and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u201d (WND-1, 832). Discussing this passage in one of his lectures, Mr. Toda said:\n\n\u201cAlthough we may pray to this great Gohonzon thinking it exists outside us, the reality is that it resides directly within the lives of us who chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with faith in the Gohonzon of the Three Great Secret Laws. This passage from the Daishonin is truly inspiring.\n\n\u201cThose who do not yet have faith in the Mystic Law are people at the \u2018stage of being a Buddha in theory\u2019 [the first of the six stages of practice],*1 where the Buddha nature, while appearing vaguely to be present, does not function in the least. We [Soka Gakkai members], on the other hand, because we chant to the Gohonzon, are at the \u2018stage of hearing the name and words of the truth\u2019 [the second of the six stages of practice]. At this stage, the Gohonzon already shines brilliantly within us.\n\n\u201cHowever, the degree to which it shines will differ depending upon the strength of each person\u2019s faith. It\u2019s like a light bulb. A high-watt light bulb shines brightly, and a low-watt light bulb shines faintly.\n\n\u201cTo continue with the analogy of a light bulb, for those who haven\u2019t yet embraced the Mystic Law, the light bulb isn\u2019t connected to a power source. Whereas for us, practitioners of the Mystic Law, the light bulb that is the Gohonzon is turned on. Therefore, our lives shine brightly.\u201d*2\n\nEverything depends on the strength of our faith. When we have strong faith, our life itself becomes a \u201ccluster of blessings\u201d (WND-1, 832), which is how the Daishonin describes the Gohonzon. He further states: \u201cThis Gohonzon also is found only in the two characters for faith\u201d*3 (WND-1, 832).\n\nPeople of strong faith, therefore, never reach a deadlock. No matter what happens, they can transform everything into a source of benefit and happiness. Naturally, in the long course of our lives, we are bound to encounter various kinds of problems and suffering. But we will be able to turn all difficulties into nourishment for developing a higher state of life. In this respect, for practitioners of the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism, everything is ultimately a source of benefit and happiness at the most profound level. The word \u201cunhappiness\u201d does not exist in the vocabulary of those who have strong faith.\n\nToward the end of his Commentary on \u201cThe Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind,\u201d Nichikan Shonin [a great restorer of Nichiren Buddhism who began the task of systematizing the Daishonin\u2019s teachings writes:\n\n\u201cWhen we embrace faith in this object of devotion [the Gohonzon] and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, our lives immediately become the object of devotion of three thousand realms in a single moment of life;*4 they become the life of Nichiren Daishonin. This is the true meaning of the phrase \u2018he [the Buddha] then adorned the necks of the ignorant people of the latter age [with the five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo].\u2019*5 (cf. WND-1, 376). Therefore, we must venerate the power of the Buddha and the power of the Law and strive to develop our own power of faith and power of practice. We must not spend our lives in vain and regret it for all eternity, as the Daishonin says.*6 (cf. WND-1, 622)\u201d\n\nIn this passage, Nichikan Shonin clearly states that, through faith in the Gohonzon, our lives can instantly manifest the object of devotion and life state of Nichiren Daishonin. It was for this very purpose that the Daishonin inscribed the Gohonzon. Here, we find the supreme essence of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nFaith enables us to manifest the Gohonzon that exists within us; it allows us to bring forth the diamond-like state of the Buddha and make it shine brightly.\n\nWithin the depths of our lives, we each inherently possess boundless life force and a wellspring of infinite wisdom. Faith allows us to freely tap that inner life force and wisdom.\n\nMr. Toda often used to say: \u201cWhat\u2019s inside you comes out. What\u2019s not there, won\u2019t.\u201d The strong and pure state of Buddhahood and the weak and base states of hell, hunger, and animality all exist within our lives and are manifested in response to causes and conditions in our environment.\n\nSince life is eternal throughout the three existences of past, present, and future, our past karma may also assail us in the present in the form of some major problem or suffering. However, just as the cause of suffering lies within our lives, we also possess the power to transform our suffering into happiness. This is the power of the life state of Buddhahood.\n\nAs Mr. Toda declared, ultimately human beings are the product of what lies inside them, no more, no less.\n\nIt\u2019s vital, therefore, that we each cultivate the \u201cearth\u201d of our lives and put down deep and extensive \u201croots\u201d of happiness. We must manifest the Gohonzon that exists within us and forge a self that is as unshakable as a mighty tree. In terms of our life state, this will be expressed as outstanding humanity and exemplary behavior, while in terms of our daily lives, it will manifest as benefit and good fortune.\n\nThe crucial point is whether we have faith. We must never make light of the Daishonin\u2019s assertion that \u201cIt is the heart that is important\u201d (WND-1, 1000).\n\nWhat matters is not form or a person\u2019s position or wealth. Those who have faith in their hearts are truly happy.\n\nFrom a speech at a representatives gathering, Tokyo, April 3, 1993.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Six stages of practice: Also, six identities. Six stages in the practice of the Lotus Sutra formulated by the Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai in his Great Concentration and Insight. They are as follows: (1) The stage of being a Buddha in theory; (2) the stage of hearing the name and words of the truth; (3) the stage of perception and action; (4) the stage of resemblance to enlightenment; (5) the stage of progressive awakening; and (6) the stage of ultimate enlightenment, or the highest stage of practice.\n*2Translated from Japanese.

The \u201cthree thousand realms\u201d indicates the varying aspects that life assumes at each moment. At each moment, life manifests one of the Ten Worlds. Each of these worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself, thus making one hundred possible worlds. Each of these hundred worlds possesses the ten factors and operates within each of the three realms of existence, thus making three thousand realms. In other words, all phenomena are contained within a single moment of life, and a single moment of life permeates the three thousand realms of existence, or the entire phenomenal world.\n*5The full quote from \u201cThe Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind\u201d reads: \u201cShowing profound compassion for those unable to comprehend the gem of the doctrine of three thousand realms in a single moment of life, the Buddha wrapped it within the five characters [of Myoho-renge-kyo], with which he then adorned the necks of the ignorant people of the latter age\u201d (WND-1, 376). Myoho-renge-kyo is written with five Chinese characters, while Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is written with seven (nam, or namu, being comprised of two characters). The Daishonin often uses Myoho-renge-kyo synonymously with Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in his writings.\n*6Translated from Japanese.

He further notes that the beneficial power of the Gohonzon can only be tapped through faith.\nThe Gohonzon exists for the enlightenment and genuine happiness of all people throughout the Latter Day of the Law and into the eternal future.\n\nEnabling all living beings to attain the same enlightenment as Buddhas\u2014that is Shakyamuni\u2019s vow and the wish of all Buddhas past, present, and future. Nichiren Daishonin was the first person to reveal the object of devotion, or the Gohonzon, for actualizing this wish, manifesting it in the form of a \u201cgreat mandala\u201d (WND-1, 831).\n\nHe states: \u201cThis mandala is in no way my invention\u201d (WND-1, 831). The Gohonzon, he assures us, is not his arbitrary creation. It is the object of devotion that depicts the five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo to which Shakyamuni Buddha, seated in the treasure tower of Many Treasures, and all the Buddhas who were his emanations were awakened. In other words, the Gohonzon perfectly represents the \u201ctrue aspect of all phenomena\u201d*1 and the foundational principles of the \u201cmutual possession of the Ten Worlds\u201d*2 and \u201cthree thousand realms in a single moment of life,\u201d*3 all of which were elucidated during the Ceremony in the Air*4 of the Lotus Sutra.\n\nWhen we look at the layout of the Gohonzon, we see that Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u2014referred to in this letter as \u201cthe five characters of the Lotus Sutra\u2019s title\u201d (WND-1, 831)\u2014is written down the center, flanked by representatives of each of the Ten Worlds.*5 This indicates that all living beings of the Ten Worlds, from the Buddhas and bodhisattvas on down, are without exception embodied in the Gohonzon. And it accords with the passage from the \u201cTreasure Tower\u201d chapter of the Lotus Sutra that the Daishonin cited in this letter: \u201c[Shakyamuni Buddha used his transcendental powers to] lift all the members of the great assembly up into the air\u201d [LSOC11, 215] (WND-1, 832). The Gohonzon, therefore, includes \u201cwithout exception all of the various beings\u201d of the Ten Worlds. It is a representation of the \u201cmutual possession of the Ten Worlds,\u201d the principle that all living beings, when illuminated by the light of the Mystic Law, can display the \u201cdignified attributes that they inherently possess\u201d (WND-1, 832).\n\nWhen the light of the wisdom and compassion of Buddhahood illuminates the Ten Worlds within our lives, we can bring forth the power of supreme goodness and create enduring value. It also means that each individual comes to shine as an entity of the Mystic Law and to display their inherently dignified nature.\n\nIn such a realm, everyone\u2014no matter their circumstances or whether they are still transforming their karma\u2014shines with the \u201cdignified attributes that they inherently possess.\u201d Those in the world of hell, for instance, manifest the world of hell contained within the world of Buddhahood. Though there may still be suffering, it is not the hopeless suffering of wandering lost in eternal darkness. They can bring forth the courage to face difficult realities head-on, the wisdom to surmount the obstacles arising from within and from without, and the powerful life force to make new strides forward. Sufferings become challenges that aid one\u2019s personal transformation and growth, a springboard to great development.\n\nIlluminated by the light of the Mystic Law, the noble state of life that is one with the Mystic Law functions vibrantly even in the world of hell. The meaning of the sufferings of hell is thereby turned around completely.\n\nEvery person\u2019s life inherently embodies the principles of the \u201cmutual possession of the Ten Worlds\u201d and \u201cthree thousand realms in a single moment of life.\u201d In essence, every person\u2019s life is perfect and complete\u2014there is nothing extraneous to be subtracted and nothing lacking to be added. No life is without its joys and sorrows, its ups and downs. And no matter how we might try, we cannot avoid the universal sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death.\n\nThe mutual possession of the Ten Worlds is the true aspect of life, and each of the mutually inclusive Ten Worlds is an expression of the Mystic Law. The Gohonzon and our faith enable us to activate the Mystic Law in our lives and firmly establish it as our foundation.\n\nThe layout of the Gohonzon is based on the true aspect of all phenomena elucidated in the Lotus Sutra; it clarifies that we as ordinary people, in our present form, can reveal the boundless life state of Buddhahood.\n\nNo such object of devotion ever existed in Buddhism before this. Though there were many magnificent depictions of Buddhas and bodhisattvas in paintings and sculptures, there was no mandala embodying the principle of the \u201cmutual possession of the Ten Worlds\u201d that enabled ordinary people to attain enlightenment. Nichiren Daishonin was the first to reveal the Gohonzon that illuminates the \u201cdignified attributes that we inherently possess,\u201d that is, the object of devotion for the enlightenment of all humanity. This Gohonzon is truly the \u201cgreat mandala never before known\u201d (WND-1, 832), depicting the realm of religion that includes and benefits all people.\n\nIn the Daishonin\u2019s day\u2014and often even today\u2014we find the deeply rooted view that we are but small, insignificant beings and that, in contrast, ultimate reality, or enduring value, is something that lies somewhere outside of us, somewhere far away. Such thinking is inextricably connected with a belief in some otherworldly supernatural power.\n\nNichiren Buddhism, however, rejects this idea. It teaches that the true reality of life, in which the eternal and ultimate Law is revealed, is to be found in ordinary people living right here and now.\n\nThe term Buddha, after all, means \u201cenlightened one.\u201d To what did the Buddha become enlightened? It was to that which should form the true basis of our life\u2014namely, the Law and the true essence of our being. He awakened to the universal Law permeating all phenomena, which had previously been obscured by fundamental ignorance.*6 He awakened to the greatness of each individual\u2019s life that is one and indivisible with that Law.\n\nThe Daishonin refers to the Gohonzon as the \u201cobject of devotion for observing the mind\u201d (WND-1, 354ff.). The purpose of the Gohonzon is to enable us to \u201cobserve our mind,\u201d that is, to see and awaken to the Buddhahood within our own life. But being able to see the true nature of our mind, or attain enlightenment, is not achieved through contemplation or meditative practice. Faith is the foundation. The \u201cobject of devotion for observing the mind\u201d is the \u201cobject of devotion of faith.\u201d\n\nThe Gohonzon (Buddhahood) is expressed in the lives of those who have strong faith. A person may possess the Gohonzon, but without faith, they will receive no benefit. Faith is what causes the \u201ccluster of blessings\u201d (WND-1, 832) that is the Gohonzon to reveal itself in our life.*7 Accordingly, as long as our faith stays alive, the \u201ccluster of blessings\u201d will never disappear. Even if we were to lose our material Gohonzon in an accident or natural disaster, as long as we retain our faith, the Gohonzon within our life is eternal and ever-abiding, and we can activate its beneficial power.\n\nOnly when we have faith does the beneficial power of the Gohonzon emerge. Truly, the Gohonzon is found in our faith alone.\n\nFrom Learning from the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin: The Teachings for Victory, published in Japanese in December 2014.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1True aspect of all phenomena: The ultimate truth or reality that permeates all phenomena and is in no way separate from them. Through the explanation of the ten factors, the \u201cExpedient Means\u201d (2nd) chapter of the Lotus Sutra teaches that all people are inherently endowed with the potential to become Buddhas, and clarifies the truth that they can tap and manifest this potential.\n*2Mutual possession of the Ten Worlds: The principle that each of the Ten Worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself. \u201cMutual possession\u201d means that life is not fixed in one or another of the Ten Worlds, but can manifest any of the ten\u2014from hell to the state of Buddhahood\u2014at any given moment. The important point of this principle is that all beings in any of the nine worlds possess the Buddha nature. This means that every person has the potential to manifest Buddhahood, while a Buddha also possesses the nine worlds and in this sense is not separate or different from ordinary people.\n*3Three thousand realms in a single moment of life: A philosophical system established by the Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai of China based on the Lotus Sutra. The \u201cthree thousand realms\u201d indicates the varying aspects that life assumes at each moment. At each moment, life manifests one of the Ten Worlds. Each of these worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself, thus making one hundred possible worlds. Each of these hundred worlds possesses the ten factors and operates within each of the three realms of existence, thus making three thousand realms. In other words, all phenomena are contained within a single moment of life, and a single moment of life permeates the three thousand realms of existence, or the entire phenomenal world.\n*4Ceremony in the Air: One of the three assemblies described in the Lotus Sutra, in which the entire gathering is suspended in space above the saha world. The heart of this ceremony is the revelation of the Buddha\u2019s original enlightenment in the remote past and the transfer of the essence of the sutra to the Bodhisattvas of the Earth, who are led by Bodhisattva Superior Practices.\n*5Ten Worlds: The realms of hell, hungry spirits, animals, asuras, human beings, heavenly beings, voice-hearers, cause-awakened ones, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas. They are also referred to as the ten life states of hell, hunger, animality, anger, humanity, heaven, learning, realization, bodhisattva, and Buddhahood.\n*6Fundamental ignorance: The most deeply rooted illusion inherent in life, said to give rise to all other illusions. The inability to see or recognize the truth, particularly, the true nature of one\u2019s life.\n*7In \u201cThe Real Aspect of the Gohonzon,\u201d Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cNever seek this Gohonzon outside yourself. The Gohonzon exists only within the mortal flesh of us ordinary people who embrace the Lotus Sutra and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. . . . To be endowed with the Ten Worlds means that all ten, without a single exception, exist in one world. Because of this it is called a mandala. Mandala is a Sanskrit word that is translated as \u2018perfectly endowed\u2019 or \u2018a cluster of blessings.\u2019 This Gohonzon also is found only in the two characters for faith. This is what the sutra means when it states that one can \u2018gain entrance through faith alone\u2019 [LSOC3, 110]\u201d (WND-1, 832).\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.2]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.4]"}, {"title": "chapter-3-4.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.4]\n3.4 The Real Aspect and Power of the Gohonzon\nPresident Ikeda discusses the significance and layout of the Gohonzon, citing passages from the writings of Nichiren Daishonin and the Lotus Sutra.\nNichiren Daishonin states that he inscribed the Gohonzon as the \u201cbanner of propagation of the Lotus Sutra\u201d (WND-1, 831). In other words, it is the object of devotion for kosen-rufu\u2014that is, for accomplishing the wide propagation of the Mystic Law. In \u201cThe Real Aspect of the Gohonzon,\u201d he says:\n\n\u201cHow wondrous it is that, around two hundred years and more into the Latter Day of the Law, I was the first to reveal as the banner of propagation of the Lotus Sutra this great mandala [the Gohonzon of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo] that even those such as [the learned Indian Buddhist monks] Nagarjuna and Vasubandhu, [and the Great Teachers of China] T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai and Miao-lo were unable to express.\u201d (WND-1, 831)\n\nCarrying on the Daishonin\u2019s spirit, the Soka Gakkai is propagating the \u201cobject of devotion for kosen-rufu\u201d that the Daishonin, while enduring great persecution, inscribed for the happiness of the people of the Latter Day of the Law.\n\nThe Daishonin models the Gohonzon after the Ceremony in the Air*1 as depicted in the Lotus Sutra when the \u201cLife Span\u201d (16th) chapter is being expounded. The \u201cLife Span\u201d chapter reveals the eternity of the Mystic Law on three levels: the eternity of the Buddha (true effect), the eternity of living beings (true cause), and the eternity of the land (true land). [The true effect, true cause, and true land are together referred to as the three mystic principles.]\n\nThe significance of the Ceremony in the Air becomes clear with the integration of the three mystic principles in the \u201cLife Span\u201d chapter. The Ceremony in the Air symbolically reveals that the Buddha, the living beings, and the land are all entities of the eternal Mystic Law. In other words, the eternal Mystic Law pervades the entire universe. Nichiren Daishonin expressed this Law as Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.\n\nIn \u201cThe Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind,\u201d the Daishonin discusses the aspect or layout of the Gohonzon in detail.\n\nThe true object of devotion is described as follows:\n\n\u201cThe treasure tower sits in the air above the saha world that the Buddha of the essential teaching [identified as the pure and eternal land]; Myoho-renge-kyo appears in the center of the tower with the Buddhas Shakyamuni and Many Treasures seated to the right and left, and, flanking them, the four bodhisattvas, followers of Shakyamuni, led by Superior Practices. Manjushri, Maitreya, and the other bodhisattvas, who are all followers of the four bodhisattvas, are seated below. All the other major and minor bodhisattvas, whether they are disciples of the Buddha in his transient status or of the Buddhas of the other worlds, are like commoners kneeling on the ground in the presence of nobles and high-ranking court officials. The Buddhas who gathered from the other worlds in the ten directions all remain on the ground, showing that they are only temporary manifestations of the eternal Buddha and that their lands are transient, not eternal and unchanging.\u201d (WND-1, 366\u201367)\n\nIn form, the Gohonzon depicts a multi-tiered structure, with the treasure tower of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo as its central axis. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in the center indicates the fundamental truth. Since Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the central axis of life and the universe, it is expressed by the treasure tower that soars up in the center of the Ceremony in the Air.\n\nOn either side are the Buddhas Shakyamuni and Many Treasures, who represent functions of Myoho-renge-kyo (cf. WND-1, 384). Many Treasures is the Buddha of the past, signifying eternal truth, and represents the Law as the object of wisdom, or that which wisdom perceives. Shakyamuni is the Buddha of the present, and represents the wisdom to perceive the Law. Indeed, these are two aspects of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. The two Buddhas seated together indicates the \u201cfusion of reality and wisdom.\u201d*2\n\nThe important point is that we make neither Shakyamuni nor Many Treasures our object of devotion. Both Shakyamuni and Many Treasures, too, became Buddhas through Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. It is always Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the fundamental Law for attaining Buddhahood, that we make our object of devotion. In terms of the layout of the Gohonzon, this is clear from Nam-myoho-renge-kyo being written large in the center with Shakyamuni and Many Treasures positioned to either side.\n\nAwakened to Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, Buddhas unfailingly carry out bodhisattva practice to lead all people to enlightenment. The four bodhisattvas\u2014Superior Practices, Boundless Practices, Pure Practices, and Firmly Established Practices\u2014represent such bodhisattva practice.\n\nThe reason these four bodhisattvas\u2014the leaders of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth*3\u2014all have \u201cpractices\u201d in their names [as indicated by the Chinese character that means \u201cpractice\u201d or \u201caction\u201d] is that they express their wisdom of enlightenment as action. That is to say, they exhibit actions that are \u201csuperior,\u201d \u201cboundless,\u201d \u201cpure,\u201d and \u201cunwavering\u201d based on infinite life force that is one with the Mystic Law.\n\nThey can be said to correspond to the four noble virtues of Buddhahood\u2014a state of life that is forever (eternity) secure (true self), refreshed (purity), and joyful (happiness).\n\nThe Bodhisattvas of the Earth, displaying the power inherent in life, seek to protect and free from suffering all living beings and the entire world.\n\nThe Daishonin says that all the other major and minor bodhisattvas of the theoretical teaching and those from other lands are not elevated into the air but are \u201con the ground.\u201d These bodhisattvas could be said to represent various altruistic practices, or concrete actions taken to further the enlightenment of all people according to their individual circumstances.\n\nThese bodhisattvas are innumerable, and therefore they cannot all be depicted in the Gohonzon. Nevertheless, the Gohonzon unmistakably includes all of their benefit.\n\nEach of these beings of the Ten Worlds*4 who have gathered before the treasure tower of the Mystic Law express a part of the functions of the Mystic Law. Illuminated by the light of the Mystic Law, they embody the Mystic Law and \u201cdisplay the dignified attributes that they inherently possess\u201d (WND-1, 832). Displaying their unique character, they express the richness of the Mystic Law. This is the meaning of \u201cilluminating and manifesting one\u2019s true nature\u201d (cf. WND-1, 746).\n\nWhen the light of the sun passes through a prism, it divides into a continuous spectrum of colors from red to violet. Sunlight is the totality of these individual colors, each being a component of that light. The light of the sun contains countless hues. Therefore, when it shines on something, some of its colors are absorbed and some are reflected back, producing the various shades we see.\n\nThe Mystic Law is the ultimate source of life. It gives birth to and encompasses all things. Illuminated by the sunlight of this all-inclusive Mystic Law, everything shines with rich individuality.\n\nThe Daishonin explains that myo (of myoho or Mystic Law) has three meanings: to open, to be fully endowed, and to revive (cf. WND-1, 146). The benefit of the Gohonzon naturally includes these three functions. The Gohonzon (Nam-myoho-renge-kyo) has the power to unlock the Buddha nature in all people; it contains all benefit and embraces all capacities; and it has the revitalizing power to liberate people from any kind of negative karma and misery. In short, it has the power to enable everything to display its highest potential. It is a life-giving teaching.\nThe Ceremony in the Air is a \u201crealm transcending time and space.\u201d It does not take place in some historically specific time or place. That is precisely why we are able to join in the Ceremony in the Air anytime and anywhere.\n\nBy chanting to the Gohonzon, which is modeled on the Ceremony in the Air, we become one with the eternal and universal life in the present, and we open a state of life in which we can survey the entire universe from right where we are. Through our daily practice of gongyo and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we join the eternal Ceremony in the Air here and now. We cause the treasure tower to shine within us and in our daily lives and activities. That is the wonder of the Gohonzon. A magnificent \u201ccosmos\u201d of life opens to us, and reality presents itself as a world of value creation.\n\nFrom The World of Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s Writings, vol. 2, published in Japanese in January 2004.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Ceremony in the Air: One of the three assemblies described in the Lotus Sutra, in which the entire gathering is suspended in space above the saha world.

In Buddhism, mirrors have a wide variety of meanings and are often used to explain and illustrate various doctrines. Here, I would like to briefly discuss an example related to our Buddhist practice.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cA bronze mirror will reflect the form of a person but it will not reflect that person\u2019s mind. The Lotus Sutra, however, reveals not only the person\u2019s form but that person\u2019s mind as well. And it reveals not only the mind; it reflects, without the least concealment, that person\u2019s past actions and future as well.\u201d (WND-2, 619)\n\nMirrors reflect our face and outward form. The mirror of Buddhism, however, reveals the intangible aspect of our lives. Mirrors, which function by virtue of the laws of light and reflection, are a product of human ingenuity. On the other hand, the Gohonzon, based on the law of the universe and life, is the ultimate expression of Buddha wisdom. It enables us to attain Buddhahood by providing us with a means to perceive the true reality of our lives. Just as a mirror is indispensable for grooming our face and hair, we need a mirror of life that allows us to look closely at ourselves and our lives if we are to lead a happier and more beautiful existence.\n\nIn \u201cOn Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,\u201d the Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cA tarnished mirror . . . will shine like a jewel when polished. A mind now clouded by the illusions of the innate darkness of life is like a tarnished mirror, but when polished, it is sure to become like a clear mirror, reflecting the essential nature of phenomena [Dharma nature] and the true aspect of reality.\u201d (WND-1, 4)\n\nOriginally, every person\u2019s life is a brilliantly shining mirror. Differences arise depending on whether one polishes this mirror. A polished mirror corresponds to the life state of the Buddha, whereas a tarnished mirror corresponds to that of an ordinary unenlightened being. Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is how we polish our lives. Not only do we undertake this practice ourselves, we also endeavor to teach others about the Mystic Law so that they can make the mirror of their lives shine brightly, too. In this respect, we could be called master \u201cmirror polishers\u201d in the realm of life. Even though people work hard at polishing their appearance, they often tend to neglect polishing their lives. While they fret over blemishes on their face, they remain unconcerned about blemishes in the depths of their lives!\n\nIn the famous novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, the youthful protagonist, Dorian Gray, is so handsome that he is called a \u201cyoung Adonis.\u201d An artist who wishes to immortalize Dorian\u2019s beauty paints his portrait. It is a brilliant work, an embodiment of Dorian\u2019s youthfulness and beauty. It is then that something mysterious begins to happen. Dorian\u2019s beauty does not fade, even as he is gradually tempted by a friend into a life of hedonism and immorality. Although the years go by, he remains as youthful and radiant as ever. Strangely, however, the portrait begins to turn ugly and lusterless, reflecting Dorian\u2019s dissolute life.\n\nThen, one day, Dorian cruelly breaks a young woman\u2019s heart, driving her to commit suicide. At that time, the face in the portrait takes on an evil and savage expression that is frightening to behold. As Dorian\u2019s disreputable behavior continues, so does the hideous transformation of the portrait. Dorian is filled with horror. This picture would forever portray the face of his soul in all its ugliness. Even if he were to die, it would continue to eloquently convey the truth.\n\nThough Dorian makes a token effort to be a better person, the picture does not change. He decides to destroy the portrait, thinking that if it were gone, he would be able to break free from his past. So he plunges a knife into the painting. At that moment, hearing screams, his neighbors rush over to find a portrait of the handsome, young Dorian and, collapsed before it, an aged, repulsive-looking man, Dorian, with a knife sticking in his chest. The painting had been a portrait of Dorian\u2019s soul, his inner face, into which the effects of his actions had been etched without the slightest omission.\n\nThough we can cover imperfections on our face with cosmetics, we cannot conceal imperfections on the inner face of our lives. The law of cause and effect is strict and inexorable.\n\nBuddhism teaches that unseen virtue brings about visible reward. In the world of Buddhism, everything counts. Being two-faced or pretentious, therefore, serves us absolutely no purpose.\n\nOur inner face that is engraved with the positive and negative causes we make is to an extent reflected in our appearance. There is also a saying \u201cThe face is the mirror of the mind.\u201d\n\nJust as we look into a mirror when we groom our face, we need a mirror that reflects the depths of our life to beautifully polish our inner face. This mirror is none other than the Gohonzon for \u201cobserving the mind.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cThe Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind,\u201d Nichiren Daishonin explains the meaning of \u201cobserving the mind,\u201d saying: \u201cOnly when we look into a clear mirror do we see, for the first time, that we are endowed with all six sense organs [eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind]\u201d (WND-1, 356).\n\nSimilarly, \u201cobserving the mind\u201d means to perceive that one\u2019s mind, or life, contains the Ten Worlds,*1 and in particular, the world of Buddhahood. It was to enable people to do this that Nichiren Daishonin bestowed the Gohonzon for \u201cobserving the mind\u201d upon all humankind.\n\nIn his Commentary on \u201cThe Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind,\u201d Nichikan Shonin [a great restorer of Nichiren Buddhism who began the task of systematizing the Daishonin\u2019s teachings] likens the Gohonzon to a mirror, stating: \u201cThe true object of devotion can be compared to a clear mirror.\u201d*2 And in The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, Nichiren Daishonin says: \u201cThe five characters Myoho-renge-kyo [embodied in the Gohonzon] similarly reflect the ten thousand phenomena [i.e., all phenomena], not overlooking a single one of them\u201d (OTT, 51). The Gohonzon is the clearest of all mirrors, reflecting the entire universe exactly as it is. When we chant before the Gohonzon, we can perceive the true nature of our lives and manifest the world of Buddhahood.\n\nOur attitude or determination in faith is perfectly reflected in the mirror of the Gohonzon and mirrored in the universe. This accords with the principle of \u201cthree thousand realms in a single moment of life.\u201d*3\n\nIn a letter to Abutsu-bo, one of his loyal disciples on Sado Island, the Daishonin writes: \u201cYou may think you offered gifts to the treasure tower of the Thus Come One Many Treasures, but that is not so. You offered them to yourself\u201d (WND-1, 299).\n\nAn attitude in faith that reveres and honors the Gohonzon dignifies and honors the treasure tower of our own lives. When we chant before the Gohonzon, all Buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout the universe will instantly lend their support and protection. On the other hand, if we slander the Gohonzon, the opposite will be true [i.e., such support and protection will not be forthcoming]. Accordingly, our attitude or mind is extremely important. Our deep-seated attitude or determination in faith has a subtle and far-reaching influence.\n\nThere may be times, for instance, when you feel reluctant to do gongyo or take part in Soka Gakkai activities. That state of mind will be unerringly reflected in the universe, as if on the surface of a clear mirror. The heavenly deities will then also feel reluctant to play their part, and they will naturally fail to exert their full protective powers.\n\nOn the other hand, when you joyfully do gongyo and carry out activities for kosen-rufu with the determination to accumulate even more good fortune in your life, the heavenly deities will be delighted and actively function to support you. If you are going to take some action anyway, it is to your advantage to do so willingly and joyfully.\n\nIf you carry out your Buddhist practice reluctantly with a sense that it\u2019s a waste of time, doubt and complaint will erase your benefits. Of course, if you continue in this way, you will fail to perceive any benefit from your practice, only further reconfirming your incorrect conviction that there\u2019s no point in practicing. This is a vicious circle. If you practice Nichiren Buddhism filled with doubt and skepticism, you will get results that are, at best, vague and unsatisfactory. This is the reflection of your own weak conviction in faith on the mirror of the universe. On the other hand, when you stand up with strong conviction in faith, you will accrue limitless good fortune and benefit.\n\nIt\u2019s important that we vibrantly open up and free our mind of faith, which is both extremely subtle and far-reaching, while striving for self-mastery. When we do so, both our life and state of mind will expand limitlessly, and every action we take will become a source of benefit. Deeply mastering the subtle and far-reaching workings of the mind is the key to faith and to attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime.\n\nThere is a Russian proverb that says: \u201cDon\u2019t blame the mirror if your face is awry.\u201d The reflection in the mirror is our own. But some people get angry with the mirror!\n\nIn the same way, our happiness or unhappiness is entirely a reflection of the positive and negative causes accumulated in our lives. We cannot blame others for our misfortunes. This is even more so in the realm of faith.\n\nThere is a Japanese folk tale about a small village where no one had a mirror. In those days, mirrors were priceless. A man, returning from a trip to the capital, handed his wife a mirror as a souvenir. It was the first time for her to see one. Looking into the mirror, she exclaimed: \u201cWho on earth is this woman? You must\u2019ve brought a girl back with you from the capital!\u201d And so a big fight ensued.\n\nThough this is an amusing anecdote, many people become angry or distraught over phenomena that are actually nothing but a reflection of their own lives\u2014their state of mind and the causes that they have created. Like the wife in the story who exclaims, \u201cWho on earth is this woman?\u201d they do not realize their own folly.\n\nIgnorant of the mirror of life of Buddhism, such people cannot see themselves as they really are. And ignorant of their own true self, they naturally cannot give proper guidance and direction to others, nor can they discern the true nature of occurrences in society.\n\nFrom a speech at an SGI-USA women\u2019s division meeting, U.S.A., February 27, 1990.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Ten Worlds: The realms of hell, hungry spirits, animals, asuras, human beings, heavenly beings, voice-hearers, cause-awakened ones, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas. They are also referred to as the ten life states of hell, hunger, animality, anger, humanity, heaven, learning, realization, bodhisattva, and Buddhahood.\n*2Translated from Japanese.

Each of these worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself, thus making one hundred possible worlds. Each of these hundred worlds possesses the ten factors and operates within each of the three realms of existence, thus making three thousand realms. In other words, all phenomena are contained within a single moment of life, and a single moment of life permeates the three thousand realms of existence, or the entire phenomenal world.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.4]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.6]"}, {"title": "chapter-3-6.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.6]\n3.6 The Profound Meaning of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\nWhat is Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, and what is the significance of the practice of chanting it? In this selection, President Ikeda refers to passages of the Daishonin\u2019s writings to explain the fundamentals of Nichiren Buddhism.\nThe practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo contains immeasurable benefit, for it enables us to summon forth in our own lives the limitless power of the Mystic Law, the fundamental law of the universe.\n\nNichiren Daishonin stood up to actualize happiness for all humankind through the boundless beneficial power of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. The doctrinal basis for this endeavor is set forth with great simplicity and conciseness in the opening passage of his writing \u201cOn Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime\u201d:\n\n\u201cIf you wish to free yourself from the sufferings of birth and death you have endured since time without beginning and to attain without fail unsurpassed enlightenment in this lifetime, you must perceive the mystic truth that is originally inherent in all living beings. This truth is Myoho-renge-kyo. Chanting Myoho-renge-kyo will therefore enable you to grasp the mystic truth innate in all life.\u201d (WND-1, 3)\n\nThis passage encapsulates the profound principles of Buddhism and the history of the religious revolution to bring about the enlightenment of all people. Each word and phrase is infused with the sublime wisdom of Buddhism.\n\nThe Daishonin\u2019s reference to \u201cthe sufferings of birth and death endured since time without beginning\u201d is premised on the concept of transmigration, according to which living beings undergo an unceasing, suffering-filled cycle of birth and death that continues from the infinite past into the infinite future. Buddhism holds that this never-ending round of suffering ultimately arises from earthly desires, and that a negative cycle of earthly desires, karma, and suffering is part and parcel of transmigration. In this sense, \u201cthe sufferings of birth and death endured since time without beginning\u201d also represent an interminable succession of delusion and suffering.\n\nBecause the thought of such endless transmigration is ultimately unbearable, people naturally came to wish for a way to put an end to this painful cycle of birth and death and free themselves from the chains of delusion and suffering.\n\nIn Buddhism, there are two basic approaches to liberation from the suffering of this cycle. One view holds that people can free themselves from the endless karmic cycle of birth and death by eradicating earthly desires believed to cause it. The other is the Mahayana approach, in which the essence of life that undergoes transmigration is not viewed as a transient, impermanent phenomenon.\n\nThe Mahayana teachings, for example, espouse the concept of undergoing the cycle of birth and death in accordance with the bodhisattva vow to guide living beings to enlightenment; or they view the alternation between birth and death itself as a cycle of emerging from and returning to the fundamental, all-embracing life of the universe. The latter view can be easily understood using the metaphor of waves on the ocean: birth is like a wave appearing on the surface of the ocean\u2014the life of the universe\u2014while death is the wave submerging back into that ocean. Gaining such an understanding of the essence of our own lives, which repeat the cycle of birth and death, is to attain \u201cunsurpassed enlightenment,\u201d the highest awakening of the Buddha.\n\nIn this passage, to \u201cperceive the mystic truth that is originally inherent in all living beings\u201d means to \u201cattain unsurpassed enlightenment.\u201d The wisdom to apprehend this universally inherent truth represents the supreme enlightenment of the Buddha.\n\nThe point where Buddhism radically departs from the philosophies and religions that preceded it is that it uncovered within the individual\u2019s own life the Law, or limitless inner power, for resolving all suffering on the most essential level. A Buddha is one who, based on this Law, has attained the ultimate wisdom to fundamentally put an end to suffering and construct unshakable happiness.\n\nBuddhism is a teaching of unparalleled humanism that stresses the boundless potential within human beings. That\u2019s why it is called the \u201cinternal way.\u201d\n\nTo \u201cperceive the mystic truth that is originally inherent in all living beings\u201d is to \u201cattain unsurpassed enlightenment,\u201d and is the sole means for freeing oneself from \u201cthe sufferings of birth and death endured since time without beginning.\u201d This is Shakyamuni\u2019s starting point, and the ultimate conclusion of Buddhist thought. The scripture that gives highest expression to this philosophy of the internal way is the Lotus Sutra, which teaches that all people can attain enlightenment. The Lotus Sutra could be said to embody the ultimate principle of respect for human dignity.\n\nIn this writing [\u201cOn Attaining Buddhahood in this Lifetime\u201d], the Daishonin says that the \u201cmystic truth that is originally inherent in all living beings\u201d is the \u201cprinciple of the mutually inclusive relationship of a single moment of life and all phenomena\u201d (WND-1, 3). This latter principle refers to the inscrutable relationship that exists between ourselves\u2014our minds or each life-moment\u2014and the universe; its meaning is that all phenomena are contained in one\u2019s life and that one\u2019s life pervades all phenomena.\n\nThe life of the universe enfolds and pervades everything, and because it does so, it is also inherent in all things. The oneness of the life of the universe and our individual lives lies at the heart of the \u201cprinciple of the mutually inclusive relationship of a single moment of life and all phenomena.\u201d To awaken to this mystic truth is to attain the Buddha\u2019s \u201cunsurpassed enlightenment.\u201d\n\nThe question is how to enable all people to perceive this \u201cmystic truth that is originally inherent in all living beings.\u201d A widely accessible Buddhism will not be possible if only a very limited number of people can follow the way set forth for apprehending the mystic truth.\n\nThe initial step the Daishonin took in opening the great path to enlightenment for all people was to name the mystic truth. The universally inherent mystic truth originally had no name, but as the Daishonin explains in \u201cThe Entity of the Mystic Law,\u201d a sage awakened to this truth in his own life was able to give it the most appropriate name (WND-1, 421).*1 Naming something is a creative process. Giving a name that accurately captures the essence of a thing has the important effect of making that essence available to all people; it enables all people to share in its value.\n\nIn \u201cOn Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,\u201d as indicated by the passage \u201cthe mystic truth that is originally inherent in all living beings is Myoho-renge-kyo,\u201d(cf. WND-1, 3), the Daishonin clearly states that this mystic truth that constitutes the fundamental law of the universe is none other than Myoho-renge-kyo. Strictly speaking, the term Myoho-renge-kyo existed prior to this as the title of the Lotus Sutra, but the Daishonin was the first to identify Myoho-renge-kyo as the name of the principle of the \u201ctrue aspect of all phenomena,\u201d*2 which the Lotus Sutra teaches is the profound wisdom of all Buddhas. Also, although the \u201cLife Span\u201d chapter of the Lotus Sutra expounds the life of the eternal Buddha from the standpoint of Shakyamuni, it was the Daishonin who first revealed that the \u201cheart of the \u2018Life Span\u2019 chapter\u201d is Myoho-renge-kyo (cf. WND-1, 371).\n\nThe eternal Buddha, since attaining enlightenment in the remote past, repeatedly undergoes the cycle of birth and death as a Buddha while appearing in various forms within the Ten Worlds*3 to free living beings from suffering. The \u201cLife Span\u201d chapter reveals that living beings of the Ten Worlds (including Buddhas) and both birth and death are all manifestations of the great eternal life of the universe. Because the Daishonin says that the \u201cheart of the \u2018Life Span\u2019 chapter\u201d is Myoho-renge-kyo, we can infer that Myoho-renge-kyo is the name of the great, eternal, universal life that is revealed in the \u201cLife Span\u201d chapter.\n\nLiving beings in the nine worlds repeatedly undergoing birth and death also follow the rhythm of birth and death of emerging from and submerging back into the great eternal life that is Myoho-renge-kyo. They are embraced by Myoho-renge-kyo, and at the same time possess Myoho-renge-kyo within them. This is why Myoho-renge-kyo is the name of the \u201cmystic truth that is originally inherent in all living beings.\u201d\n\nIt was the Daishonin who first declared that Myoho-renge-kyo is to be chanted and spread in the Latter Day of the Law.\n\nThe Daishonin\u2019s next step in opening this great path was to establish the practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. He appended the word nam\u2014a transliteration of the Sanskrit word namas, meaning \u201cdevotion\u201d\u2014to the universal truth of Myoho-renge-kyo, and established the practice of invoking this truth. Nam means \u201cto dedicate one\u2019s life.\u201d Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo aloud represents a determination and vow to dedicate one\u2019s life to the realm of truth of Myoho-renge-kyo in thought, word, and deed.\n\nAt the same time, chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo enables each person to actualize a way of life based on the universal truth of Myoho-renge-kyo. The crucial point in chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in Nichiren Buddhism is not simply intoning the name of an external truth. It constitutes a practice to actually summon forth the inner truth that pervades the universe and our own selves and live our lives in accord with that truth. This practice could be described as a process of establishing a self capable of activating and tapping from within the \u201cmystic truth originally inherent in all living beings.\u201d\n\nIn order to enable all people to perceive and actualize the \u201cmystic truth originally inherent in all living beings,\u201d the Daishonin gave it the name Myoho-renge-kyo and established the practice of reciting that name\u2014the practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. By doing so, he opened the way for all people to dedicate their lives to and live based on the mystic truth.\n\nThe Daishonin thus established the means by which all people can awaken to the fact that the truth of life and the universe exists within their own lives, and actively manifest that truth. Moreover, this truth is the enlightened wisdom of all Buddhas and is fully revealed in the Lotus Sutra, which is the highest teaching of Buddhism. By basing ourselves on that truth, we can lead lives of supreme value. Nichiren Buddhism made this realm of truth accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime, no matter what their background. It would be no exaggeration to say that the practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in Nichiren Buddhism gave rise to a Buddhism of the people, open to all. This practice of chanting is indeed the supreme Buddhist practice, making it possible for us to fundamentally transform our lives.\n\nTo chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is to summon forth our own innate Buddhahood (cf. WND-1, 887).*4 It is the direct path to manifesting that highest state of life. The wisdom and compassion of the Buddha that emerge through chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo enrich our being and bring happiness to ourselves and others. Further, as more and more people come to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo for the happiness of themselves and others, it will be possible to forge an alliance of people filled with the compassion of the Buddha and to ultimately transform even the destiny of humankind.\n\nAnother point we should bear in mind regarding the true meaning of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is that it is also the name of the life of the Buddha of the Latter Day, Nichiren Daishonin. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and the life of Buddha of the Latter Day are indivisibly connected. We could say that the fundamental truth of Myoho-renge-kyo that pervades life and the universe was only identified and established for the first time through the Daishonin himself practicing it and manifesting it in his behavior. He gave concrete expression to the Law that people had not been able to perceive up to that point.\n\nNichiren Daishonin\u2019s life as the Buddha of the Latter Day is none other than a life dedicated to battling evil and vanquishing fundamental ignorance.*5 The struggle to free people from all misfortune and misery in the world, from all karma and the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death, ultimately entails battling the ignorance that gives rise to evil and suffering.\n\nThe chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, established by the Daishonin for the happiness of oneself and others and the realization of kosen-rufu, has the power to clear the clouds of ignorance (cf. WND-2, 85). When we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the sun of the world of Buddhahood rises in our hearts. The ignorance and delusion, like heavy clouds shrouding the sun, are swept away. When the sun of Buddhahood comes to shine within us, the darkness of ignorance vanishes.\n\nNichiren Buddhism is not a teaching in which the Daishonin alone shines like the sun. It is a teaching in which all of us can bring the sun of Buddhahood to rise in our lives just as he did. We are truly fortunate in that we can manifest the same brilliant life state of Buddhahood as Nichiren Daishonin.\n\nFrom Lecture on \u201cOn Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,\u201d published in Japanese in January 2007.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1In \u201cThe Entity of the Mystic Law,\u201d the Daishonin writes: \u201cThis passage of commentary [in T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai\u2019s Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra] means that the supreme principle [that is the Mystic Law] was originally without a name. When the sage was observing the principle and assigning names to all things, he perceived that there is this wonderful single Law [myoho] that simultaneously possesses both cause and effect [renge], and he named it Myoho-renge. This single Law that is Myoho-renge encompasses within it all the phenomena comprising the Ten Worlds and the three thousand realms, and is lacking in none of them. Anyone who practices this Law will obtain both the cause and the effect of Buddhahood simultaneously\u201d (WND-1, 421).\n*2True aspect of all phenomena: The ultimate truth or reality that permeates all phenomena and is in no way separate from them. Through the explanation of the ten factors, the \u201cExpedient Means\u201d (2nd) chapter of the Lotus Sutra teaches that all people are inherently endowed with the potential to become Buddhas, and clarifies the truth that they can tap and manifest this potential.\n*3Ten Worlds: The realms of hell, hungry spirits, animals, asuras, human beings, heavenly beings, voice-hearers, cause-awakened ones, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas. They are also referred to as the ten life states of hell, hunger, animality, anger, humanity, heaven, learning, realization, bodhisattva, and Buddhahood.\n*4In \u201cHow Those Initially Aspiring to the Way Can Attain Buddhahood through the Lotus Sutra,\u201d the Daishonin writes: \u201cWhen we revere Myoho-renge-kyo inherent in our own life as the object of devotion, the Buddha nature within us is summoned forth and manifested by our chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. This is what is meant by \u2018Buddha\u2019\u201d (WND-1, 887).\n*5Fundamental ignorance: The most deeply rooted illusion inherent in life, said to give rise to all other illusions. The inability to see or recognize the truth, particularly, the true nature of one\u2019s life.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.5]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.7]"}, {"title": "chapter-3-7.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.7]\n3.7 Embracing the Gohonzon Is in Itself Attaining Enlightenment\nPresident Ikeda explains how Nichiren Buddhism views the concept of attaining enlightenment, or Buddhahood.\nNam-myoho-renge-kyo is the ultimate Law that gives rise to, or is the source of, all Buddhas. To put it another way, the fundamental cause for the enlightenment of all Buddhas is not countless kalpas of practice,*1 but rather awakening to the fundamental Law of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. The Buddhist practice for the Latter Day of the Law is to directly embrace Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. This is why practice over countless kalpas is not necessary in Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nIn his writing \u201cThe Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind,\u201d Nichiren Daishonin states: \u201cShakyamuni\u2019s practices and the virtues he consequently attained are all contained within the five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo.*2 If we believe in these five characters, we will naturally be granted the same benefits as he was\u201d (WND-1, 365).\n\nThe practices of Shakyamuni and the Buddhas of the ten directions and three existences to attain enlightenment and the virtues resulting from those practices are all included in Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. For that reason, by embracing the \u201cfive characters of Myoho-renge-kyo,\u201d we naturally obtain the full benefits enjoyed by Shakyamuni and all Buddhas, and are able to attain Buddhahood.\n\nThis is the principle that \u201cembracing the Gohonzon is in itself observing one\u2019s own mind, or attaining enlightenment.\u201d*3 It is also articulated as \u201cattainment of Buddhahood in one\u2019s present form\u201d*4 and \u201cimmediate attainment of enlightenment.\u201d*5\n\nThe Daishonin says that those who embrace the Mystic Law \u201ccan readily become as noble a Buddha as Shakyamuni\u201d (WND-1, 1030). The Daishonin\u2019s teaching opens the way for all people to reach the same great state of Buddhahood as Shakyamuni. Buddhahood is not a fiction or a metaphor, nor is it restricted to the inconceivably distant future. Nichiren Buddhism enables all people to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime.\n\nThe principle of \u201cembracing the Gohonzon is in itself observing one\u2019s own mind\u201d represents a revolution in the concept of attaining Buddhahood. As Mr. Toda explained:\n\n\u201cJust by chanting the single phrase of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with faith in the Gohonzon, we can carry out the practice for attaining Buddhahood far more easily than the Buddhas described in the \u201cExpedient Means\u201d chapter of the Lotus Sutra, who practiced for tens of millions of years [over countless lifetimes before attaining Buddhahood].\u201d*6\n\nWhile the widely accepted view of attaining Buddhahood is that it is a long, strenuous uphill climb to reach the summit of enlightenment, Nichiren Buddhism teaches that all people can reach that summit instantly. We can immediately and directly attain the expansive state of Buddhahood here and now, as though suddenly gazing from on high over the mountain peaks below and enjoying a magnificent, 360-degree panorama of the world. We can then go out among the challenging realities of living and share with others the joy of attaining this lofty state of being. This is what is so wonderful and exciting about the practice of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nFrom Lectures on the \u201cExpedient Means\u201d and \u201cLife Span\u201d Chapters of the Lotus Sutra, vol. 1, published in Japanese in September 1995.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Countless kalpas of practice: Practice toward enlightenment over a period of countless kalpas (one kalpa being approximately 16 million years according to one account). In the pre-Lotus Sutra teachings, attaining enlightenment, or Buddhahood, was thought to require countless kalpas of practice over many lifetimes. This idea contrasts with that of attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime or in a single lifetime.\n*2Myoho-renge-kyo is written with five Chinese characters, while Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is written with seven (nam, or namu, being comprised of two characters). The Daishonin often uses Myoho-renge-kyo synonymously with Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in his writings.\n*3Embracing the Gohonzon is in itself observing one\u2019s own mind: In other words, through faith in the Gohonzon, one can tap the Mystic Law inherent in one\u2019s life and attain Buddhahood.\n*4Attaining Buddhahood in one\u2019s present form: This means attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime just as one is, without undergoing endless eons of Buddhist practice.\n*5Immediately attaining enlightenment: This means the immediate attainment of Buddhahood based on the doctrine of three thousand realms in a single moment of life. It refers to beings in the nine worlds bringing forth their inherent Buddhahood and attaining enlightenment. The term is used in contrast to attaining Buddhahood through transformation, that is, through devoting oneself ceaselessly to arduous Buddhist practice over countless lifetimes until one gradually ascends to the highest stage of supreme enlightenment.\n*6Translated from Japanese.

It also embodies a crucial philosophy of faith for attaining genuine happiness.\n\nReligion is generally held to be a universal endeavor to connect the human being to the infinite, absolute, and sacred. While in a sense this may be true, it seems that many religions postulate from the outset a separation between the secular and the sacred and between human beings and gods or Buddhas, and thus seek to bridge that gap.\n\nThe Daishonin, however, regards teachings that view the absolute or sacred as separate from human beings as incomplete. And he cites as an example the provisional, pre-Lotus Sutra Buddhist teachings, which do not set forth the principles or practice that enable ordinary people to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime. Rather, they espouse that one must first undergo countless kalpas of practice over many lifetimes before enlightenment can be achieved. In the provisional, pre-Lotus Sutra teachings, a virtually insurmountable gulf exists between Buddhas and ordinary people. As long as that divide exists between the world of Buddhahood and the nine worlds [the realm of ordinary beings], it naturally follows that there is no way for all people to attain enlightenment. In this worldview, ordinary people and the idealized Buddhas are poles apart, thus leaving ordinary people with no option but to aspire for salvation through the assistance or intervention of such Buddhas.\n\nThis perceived separation between the nine worlds and the world of Buddhahood is demolished by the Lotus Sutra doctrine of \u201cthree thousand realms in a single moment of life\u201d\u2014in other words, the teaching that \u201cthe nine worlds have the potential for Buddhahood and that Buddhahood retains the nine worlds\u201d (WND-1, 539). Here we can see the immense importance of the Lotus Sutra principle of the \u201cmutual possession of the Ten Worlds.\u201d*2\n\nThe Daishonin opened the way to actualizing this latter principle, which is the key to attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime, by establishing the practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. This constitutes in its fullest and most complete form the teaching of Buddhism that seeks enlightenment for all human beings.\n\nThe Mystic Law is the fundamental law of the universe. Its universality transcends our individual selves. However, the Mystic Law also exists within our lives (cf. WND-1, 3). It both resides within us and transcends us. Put another way, the Mystic Law is inherent in our lives because it is the all-embracing Law that pervades everything in the universe.\n\nRegarding the meaning of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the Daishonin further states: \u201cWhen we revere Myoho-renge-kyo inherent in our own life as the object of devotion, the Buddha nature within us is summoned forth and manifested by our chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. This is what is meant by \u2018Buddha\u2019\u201d (WND-1, 887). The expression \u201cis summoned forth and manifested\u201d points to the profound significance of the Mystic Law.\n\nThe Daishonin uses a wonderful metaphor to explain this principle of calling forth and revealing the inner Buddha nature: \u201cWhen a caged bird sings, birds who are flying in the sky are thereby summoned and gather around, and when the birds flying in the sky gather around, the bird in the cage strives to get out\u201d (WND-1, 887).\n\nThe singing of the caged bird refers to the chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo by ordinary people who, shackled in the chains of fundamental ignorance*3 and earthly desires, arouse faith in the Mystic Law. In other words, it is the chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with faith, determined to win over all obstacles and become happy without fail through the power of the Mystic Law.\n\nThe power of such strong, resolute chanting calls forth the Buddha nature in all living beings. Not only does the Buddha nature of [the protective gods] Brahma and Shakra and of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout the universe manifest, but those chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo can also sever the chains of fundamental ignorance and illusion, and reveal their own Buddha nature. In other words, it is the power of our voices chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo that connects our lives with the Mystic Law pervading all phenomena in the universe.\n\nThe Daishonin\u2019s most important admonition in regard to attaining enlightenment through chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is that we must not view the Law as something outside ourselves. If we think the Law exists externally, then we are reverting to the kind of divide between Buddhas and ordinary people found in the pre-Lotus Sutra teachings.\n\nThroughout everything, Mr. Toda steadfastly continued to seek the Law that exists nowhere but within our own lives. And he stressed the importance of living true to oneself. His starting point was his profound realization in prison that the Buddha is life itself and his awakening to his identity as a Bodhisattva of the Earth.\n\nHe also often spoke of the spirit of faith we need in order to perceive the Mystic Law within us, saying: \u201cYou have to be resolved that Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is your own life!\u201d and \u201cPropagating the Mystic Law in the Latter Day of the Law simply means deciding, \u2018My life is none other than Nam-myoho-renge-kyo!\u2019\u201d This is the spirit the Daishonin teaches in the passage: \u201cWhen you chant myoho and recite renge, you must summon up deep faith that Myoho-renge-kyo is your life itself\u201d (WND-1, 3).\n\nThe Daishonin saw the power of the Mystic Law, which encompasses and sustains all things in the universe, as existing within human beings, and he established a means for actually manifesting that Law in their lives.\n\nIt is only by communing and fusing with the power (\u201cother power\u201d) of the eternal, unchanging truth transcending our limited, finite selves that we can wholly activate our own power (\u201cself power\u201d). At the same time, however, this eternal, all-encompassing \u201cother power\u201d actually exists inherently in our lives. The Daishonin writes: \u201cPeople are certainly self-empowered, and yet they are not self-empowered. . . . People are certainly other-empowered, and yet they are not other-empowered\u201d (WND-2, 62).*4 What this means, I believe, is that by relying neither exclusively on \u201cother power\u201d nor on \u201cself power,\u201d we can bring forth from within us the power that transcends us. Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo enables us to do this.\n\nIn this way, Nichiren Buddhism opens up a broad new vision of a universal religion for the happiness of all humankind\u2014one that transcends the approach of teachings that strictly divide the powers of self and other and that emphasize one over the other.\n\nFrom Lecture on \u201cOn Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,\u201d published in Japanese in January 2007.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Myoho-renge-kyo is written with five Chinese characters, while Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is written with seven (nam, or namu, being comprised of two characters). The Daishonin often uses Myoho-renge-kyo synonymously with Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in his writings.\n*2Mutual possession of the Ten Worlds: The principle that each of the Ten Worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself. \u201cMutual possession\u201d means that life is not fixed in one or another of the Ten Worlds, but can manifest any of the ten\u2014from hell to Buddhahood\u2014at any given moment. The important point of this principle is that all beings in any of the nine worlds possess the Buddha nature. This means that every person has the potential to manifest Buddhahood, while a Buddha also possesses the nine worlds and in this sense is not separate or different from ordinary people.\n*3Fundamental ignorance: The most deeply rooted illusion inherent in life, said to give rise to all other illusions. The inability to see or recognize the truth, particularly, the true nature of one\u2019s life.\n*4In \u201cThe Meaning of the Sacred Teachings of the Buddha\u2019s Lifetime,\u201d the Daishonin states: \u201cNow in the teachings of the Lotus Sutra, people are certainly self-empowered, and yet they are not self-empowered. This is because one\u2019s own self, or life, at the same time possesses the nature of all living beings in the Ten Worlds. Therefore this self has from the beginning been in possession of one\u2019s own realm of Buddhahood and of the realms of Buddhahood possessed by all other living beings. Therefore when one attains Buddhahood one does not take on some new or \u2018other\u2019 Buddha identity.\n\u201cAgain, in the teachings of the Lotus Sutra, people are certainly other-empowered, and yet they are not other-empowered. The Buddhas, who are considered separate from us, are actually contained within our own selves, or the lives of us ordinary people. Those Buddhas manifest the realms of Buddhahood of all living beings in the same manner as we do\u201d (WND-2, 62).\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.7]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.9]"}, {"title": "chapter-3-9.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.9]\n3.9 A Practice Accessible to All\nChanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo comprises the entirety of the practice of Nichiren Buddhism; beyond that, ceremonies and formalities are of no importance.\nNichiren Daishonin sent many letters to his lay follower Toki Jonin. In one of them, titled \u201cOn the Four Stages of Faith and the Five Stages of Practice,\u201d he outlines the correct Buddhist practice for people in the Latter Day of the Law, clarifying that such practice lies in \u201cmaking [the] single word \u2018faith\u2019 the foundation\u201d (WND-1, 785).\n\nThe essence of Nichiren Buddhism is not ceremony or formality. It is our heart. It is our faith. The Daishonin further states that the practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with faith in the Gohonzon contains within it all other forms of practice. He explains with the following simple allegory: \u201cThe two characters that comprise the name Japan contain within them all the people and animals and wealth in the sixty-six provinces of the country, without a single omission\u201d (WND-1, 788). Similarly, he says, the phrase \u201cNam-myoho-renge-kyo\u201d contains within it the entirety of the Lotus Sutra. Therefore, the practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is itself the direct path to attaining Buddhahood. All other practices, especially those entrenched in formality, are secondary practices that, if given primary importance, can become an impediment to faith.\n\nThe Daishonin further teaches that even though we may not understand the profound meaning of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we can still gain the benefit of chanting daimoku. Here, employing another allegory, he states: \u201cWhen a baby drinks milk, it has no understanding of its taste, and yet its body is naturally nourished\u201d (WND-1, 788).\n\nThough we may not understand Buddhist doctrine, if we simply chant daimoku free of doubt, then, just as a newborn baby gains nourishment from milk, we will naturally be able to imbue our lives with the great power of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. Nichiren Buddhism is the Buddhism of the people; it exists for and is accessible to all.\n\nIn the same writing, Nichiren Daishonin states: \u201cThe five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo*1 do not represent the sutra [Lotus Sutra] text, nor are they its meaning. They are nothing other than the intent of the entire sutra\u201d (WND-1, 788). Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, which we chant, is the heart and essence of the Lotus Sutra. Fundamentally, it is the very spirit of Nichiren Daishonin. Accordingly, though we may not grasp its profound meaning entirely, when we chant daimoku with faith in the Gohonzon, we can come into contact with the Daishonin\u2019s spirit. We can bring forth within us the life state of the Daishonin that is one with Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. How truly fortunate we are!\n\nFrom a speech at an SGI-Italy representatives conference, Italy, July 2, 1992.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1 Myoho-renge-kyo is written with five Chinese characters, while Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is written with seven (nam, or namu, being composed of two characters).

In that connection, allow me today to talk a little about the key requirements for victory.\n\nThe first is chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.\n\nOur health, courage, wisdom, joy, desire to improve, self-discipline, and so on, could all be said to depend on our life force. Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo enables us to bring forth limitless life force. Those who base themselves on chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo are therefore never deadlocked.\n\nThe important thing is to continue chanting every day, no matter what happens. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the fundamental power of the universe. Please chant resounding daimoku morning and evening with the vibrant and energetic rhythm of majestic horses galloping through the heavens.\n\nWhen we chant before the Gohonzon, we are facing the Buddha, so we should remember to have a respectful attitude. Other than that, though, we should feel free to express what\u2019s in our hearts honestly and directly to the Gohonzon.\n\nThe Gohonzon is the embodiment of the Buddha endowed with infinite compassion. We should therefore chant about our desires, our problems, and our aspirations, just as they are. When we\u2019re suffering, feeling sad, or experiencing hard times, we should take everything to the Gohonzon with an open heart, like a child who throws itself into its mother\u2019s arms and clings to her. The Gohonzon will \u201clisten\u201d to everything. Let\u2019s chant as if carrying on a conversation, confiding our innermost thoughts. In time, even hellish sufferings will vanish like the morning dew and seem but a dream.\n\nIf, for instance, we recognize that we have done something wrong, we should offer sincere prayers of apology and humbly reflect on our behavior. We can resolve never to repeat the same mistake again and set forth anew.\n\nAlso, when we encounter a crucial situation, we can firmly resolve to win and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with the power of a lion\u2019s roar or the ferocity of an asura demon, as if to shake the entire universe.\n\nFurthermore, in the evening, we can joyfully chant to the Gohonzon with profound appreciation for that day.\n\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, Nichiren Daishonin cites the words: \u201cMorning after morning we rise up with the Buddha, evening after evening we lie down with the Buddha\u201d*1 (OTT, 83). This means that those who continue to chant in earnest are always together with the Daishonin, the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law. This holds true not only for this lifetime but even beyond death, with the Daishonin and all heavenly deities throughout the universe extending their protection to us. We can therefore feel a deep sense of security from the depths of our being and be free of all fear. We can enjoy and live out our lives with complete confidence.\n\nChanting transforms suffering into joy, and joy into greater joy. That\u2019s why it is important for us to single-mindedly chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, come what may, whether we are feeling happy or sad, in good times or in bad. This is the direct path to happiness.\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 11,\u201cPioneering New Frontiers\u201d chapter.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1From a commentary by Fu Ta-shih.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.9]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.11]"}, {"title": "chapter-3-11.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.11]\n3.11 The Lotus Sutra Is a Scripture of Cosmic Humanism\nNichiren Buddhism is based on the Lotus Sutra, the scripture teaching the supreme enlightenment of Shakyamuni Buddha. The pinnacle of the Mahayana teachings, the Lotus Sutra was compiled in the first century CE. It sees the eternal life state of Buddhahood inherent within all people and teaches that anyone can reveal this lofty inner potential. And it calls on practitioners to carry on the struggle to lead people to enlightenment in the evil age after Shakyamuni\u2019s death. In this excerpt, President Ikeda discusses the profound meaning contained in the sutra.\n\u201cThe scripture of the lotus flower of the Law\u201d\u2014the Lotus Sutra is the monarch of all scriptures. As a monarch, it does not reject any other teaching, but acts to enable every other teaching to be fully effective.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cUltimately, all phenomena are contained within one\u2019s life, down to the last particle of dust. The nine mountains and the eight seas are encompassed in one\u2019s body, and the sun, moon, and myriad stars are found in one\u2019s life. We, however, are like a blind person who is incapable of seeing the images reflected in a mirror, or like an infant who has no fear of water or fire. The teachings such as those of the non-Buddhist writings and those of the Hinayana and provisional Mahayana Buddhist scriptures all partially explain the phenomena inherent in one\u2019s life. They do not explain them as the Lotus Sutra does.\u201d (WND-1, 629)\n\nTeachings apart from the Lotus Sutra offer only partial explanations of the Law of life. Though partially true, they do not have the capacity on their own to revitalize all aspects of life. They are more likely, in fact, to produce distortions. The Lotus Sutra, however, is the single essential Law that unifies all these partial teachings, places them in the proper perspective, and enables them to function effectively.\n\nThis is the wisdom of the Lotus Sutra. The \u201cLife Span\u201d chapter of the Lotus Sutra likens the wisdom of the Lotus Sutra to \u201ca skilled physician who is wise and understanding\u201d (LSOC16, 268). Like a skilled physician, the wisdom of the Lotus Sutra has the power to cure those who are suffering.\n\nThe Lotus Sutra seeks to convey in an easily accessible way the truth that each of us has been a Buddha since the eternal past and will be so into the eternal future. And it was Nichiren Daishonin, the votary of the Lotus Sutra in the Latter Day of the Law, who made it possible for all people to actually experience this in their lives.\n\nThe Lotus Sutra teaches of a hidden treasure residing within us, as vast as the universe itself, that vanquishes all feelings of helplessness. It teaches us how to live vibrantly and vigorously, in rhythm with the infinite life of the universe. It teaches the true, great adventure of self-transformation.\n\nThe Lotus Sutra has a vastness that can enfold all people in a state of peace. It has cultural and artistic richness. It enables us to attain a boundless state forever imbued with the noble virtues of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity, and to live with the confidence, wherever we may be, that \u201cThis, my land, remains safe and tranquil\u201d (LSOC16, 272).\n\nThe Lotus Sutra has the drama of struggles of good over evil. It has a warmth that comforts the weary. It has a vibrant, pulsing courage that banishes all fear. It has joyous songs of living unbounded and at ease throughout past, present, and future. It has soaring freedom.\n\nIt has brilliant light, flowers, greenery, music, and scenes like epic works of art or cinema.\n\nIt offers brilliant psychology, life lessons, and guidelines for happiness and peace. It presents basic principles for healthy living.\n\nIt awakens us to the universal truth that changing our mind-set changes everything. Avoiding both the desolation of individualism and the prison of totalitarianism, it possesses the power for creating a pure land of compassion in which people help and encourage one another.\n\nBoth communism and capitalism have reduced people to being a means to an end. But the Lotus Sutra, the monarch of all scriptures, embodies a fundamental humanism in which people are the end, not the means, where people are the protagonists, the monarchs. This message of the Lotus Sutra can be described as a \u201ccosmic humanism\u201d*1\u2014a magnificent theme to guide the 21st century.\n\nFrom The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra, vol. 1, published in Japanese in March 1996.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1In his lecture \u201cA New Humanism for the Coming Century,\u201d delivered at the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation in 1997, President Ikeda explained this concept of \u201ccosmic humanism\u201d as \u201ca humanism based on an expansive cosmology, a worldview that sees the individual as being one with the entire universe, expanding and growing with it, and therefore meriting the most profound reverence.\u201d\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.10]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.12]"}, {"title": "chapter-3-12.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.12]\n3.12 Gongyo Encompasses the Heart of the Lotus Sutra\nPresident Ikeda illuminates the significance of the \u201cExpedient Means\u201d and \u201cLife Span\u201d chapters of the Lotus Sutra, from which Soka Gakkai members recite passages during gongyo.\nI once composed the following poem:\n\nMorning and evening,\njoyously attune your lives\nto the melody of the universe,\nas you recite the \u201cExpedient Means\u201d\nand \u201cLife Span\u201d chapters!\n\nWhat wonderful efforts we are making toward the creation of peace and happiness when we recite these important chapters that comprise the heart of the Lotus Sutra, the highest of all the Buddhist sutras, and vibrantly chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the supreme teaching of Buddhism and ultimate Law of the universe!\n\nThe Lotus Sutra was expounded to enable all living beings to attain enlightenment. When read in terms of its implicit meaning\u2014namely, from the doctrinal standpoint of Nichiren Buddhism\u2014the Lotus Sutra takes on profound significance as an \u201cexplanation\u201d of the object of devotion (Gohonzon) of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the fundamental Law that opens the way for the enlightenment of all living beings throughout the entire world into the eternal future of the Latter Day of the Law.\n\nThe essence of this sutra is contained in the \u201cExpedient Means\u201d chapter, which expounds the \u201ctrue aspect of all phenomena,\u201d and in the \u201cLife Span\u201d chapter, which reveals the Buddha\u2019s \u201cattainment of Buddhahood in the remote past.\u201d\n\nFrom the standpoint of Nichiren Buddhism, the \u201cExpedient Means\u201d chapter praises the wisdom of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo (the Mystic Law) as infinitely profound and immeasurable, and elucidates the principle that all living beings are Buddhas. In particular, the section that clarifies the \u201ctrue aspect of all phenomena\u201d and the \u201cten factors of life\u201d (the portion that we recite three times during gongyo) indicates that all the ever-changing forms and states of life (all phenomena) are without exception manifestations of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo (the true aspect). The Daishonin writes: \u201cAll beings and environments in the Ten Worlds*1 . . . are without exception manifestations of Myoho-renge-kyo\u201d (WND-1, 383). All living beings are inherently entities of the Mystic Law. Therefore, all those who chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and work for kosen-rufu are assured of attaining the life state of Buddhahood just as they are.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to go to some faraway place to attain Buddhahood. We don\u2019t need to become someone special. We can commune dynamically with the universe as and where we are, and fully reveal the brilliance of our own innate \u201ctrue aspect\u201d\u2014that is, our true self as an entity of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. That is the purpose of gongyo and the realm of faith. We can bring forth from within us the wisdom, courage, and compassion of the Mystic Law. We therefore have absolutely nothing to fear.\n\nThe term \u201clife span\u201d of \u201cThe Life Span of the Thus Come One\u201d chapter contains the meaning of measuring the life span and benefits of the Buddha. Read from the perspective of the meaning implicit in its text, this chapter offers a detailed description of the eternal life span and the benefits of the \u201cThus Come One Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u201d (OTT, 123) extending from the infinite past. Here, the eternal nature of life is revealed, along with the fact that this constitutes the true nature of all living beings. Also revealed in this chapter is the mission of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth*2 to spread this great Law and lead all living beings to enlightenment.\n\nThe verse section of the \u201cLife Span\u201d chapter, in particular, is a grand paean to the infinitely great, noble, and eternal life force we all possess.\n\nThe Daishonin notes that when we combine the Chinese character ji (self) of the opening line of the verse section\u2014\u201cji ga toku burrai\u201d (Since I attained Buddhahood) (LSOC16, 270)\u2014and the final Chinese character shin (body) of the closing line\u2014\u201csoku joju busshin\u201d (quickly acquire the body of a Buddha) (LSOC16, 273), this forms the word jishin, meaning \u201coneself\u201d (cf. OTT, 140). From beginning to end, the verse section praises the \u201cself\u201d and the \u201clife\u201d of the Buddha, and, as such, it is also a paean to the state of eternal and absolute freedom inherent in our lives.\n\nThe verse section offers direct answers to the ultimate questions that form the basis of all thought, philosophy, and religion\u2014in other words, the timeless questions of life, such as \u201cWhat is the meaning of our existence?\u201d \u201cWhat is the true essence of our being?\u201d \u201cWhere have we come from and where are we going?\u201d and \u201cWhat are life and death?\u201d The verse section comprises a teaching of hope and joy with the power to illuminate all humanity and all life for eternity.\n\nIn the verse section, we find the lines: \u201cGa shi do annon. Tennin jo juman.\u201d (This, my land, remains safe and tranquil, / constantly filled with heavenly and human beings) [LSOC16, 272].\n\nThere is still immense suffering in the world today\u2014suffering as painful as being \u201cconsumed in a great fire\u201d (LSOC16, 272). Our noble movement for kosen-rufu, upholding the philosophy of the eternity of life, is firmly committed to creating a world where people live together in happiness and peace\u2014an ideal society that humanity has always longed for. This is the way to secure the right to lead a happy, fulfilled existence for all people in the 21st century, an aspiration shared by countless philosophers, religious leaders, and peace scholars.\n\nFrom a speech at a world peace gongyo meeting, Tokyo, September 8, 2002.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Ten Worlds: The realms of hell, hungry spirits, animals, asuras, human beings, heavenly beings, voice-hearers, cause-awakened ones, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas.

It is an act through which, based on the Gohonzon, we can vibrantly draw forth the life force of the universe within the cosmos of our lives. We exist. We have life. The universe, too, is a giant living entity. Life is the universe and the universe is life. Each of us is a living entity, just like the universe. We are our own miniature universe.\n\nOne scholar, observing that the human body is made of the same elements produced by stars, has called human beings \u201cchildren of the stars.\u201d Our bodies are a microcosm of the universe. Not only are they made of the same matter as the universe, but they also follow the same process of generation and disintegration, the same rhythm of life and death, that pervades the cosmos. All physical laws\u2014such as gravity and the conservation of energy\u2014also affect and operate in the microcosm of each living entity.\n\nThe Earth takes 365 days, 5 hours, and 48 minutes to complete one revolution around the sun. It, too, operates according to a rigorous order. The human body, meanwhile, is said to have more than 60 trillion individual cells. When they function each day in a well-ordered fashion, correctly carrying out their respective jobs, we enjoy good health. The complexity and precision of the human body are truly wondrous. Likewise, if the Earth were to veer even slightly from its present orbit around the sun, we would be in serious trouble. Everything hangs in a delicate balance, governed by the strict principle that life and the universe are one. The same is true of each individual life\u2014of each microcosm.\n\nScience has directed its attention to the investigation of real, yet invisible, natural laws. Such investigation has led to the invention of many machines and devices that apply those laws. An understanding of the principles of buoyancy, for instance, led to the development of seagoing vessels. Likewise, the discovery of the laws of aerodynamics led to the invention of aircraft, and insight into the workings of electromagnetic waves paved the way for the development of radio and television. These natural laws, however, are only partial laws of the universe.\n\nBuddhism, on the other hand, developed out of the search for and discovery of the ultimate Law of life that is the source and foundation of all other laws and principles. This ultimate Law of life is the Mystic Law.\n\nThe Mystic Law is also invisible, yet it, too, exists without a doubt. Nichiren Daishonin inscribed the Gohonzon so that we could bring forth the power of the Mystic Law from within our own lives. That is why Mr. Toda said: \u201cI apologize for using such a simplistic analogy, but the Gohonzon can be likened to a happiness-producing device.\u201d\n\nWhen we do gongyo\u2014recite portions of the Lotus Sutra and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo before the Gohonzon\u2014the microcosm of our individual lives harmonizes seamlessly with the macrocosm of the universe. It is a sublime ceremony, an action through which we fully open the storehouse of treasures within. We can thereby tap into the wellspring of life force in the depths of our own beings. We can access the source of inexhaustible wisdom, compassion, and courage.\n\nThe universe, in its essence, is Nam-myoho-renge-kyo; our life is an expression of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo; and the Gohonzon is an embodiment of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. Since all three are Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, they are essentially one and indivisible. Therefore, when we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, our life and the universe are aligned around the Gohonzon\u2014meshing together perfectly like cogs in a machine\u2014and we begin to move in the direction of happiness and fulfillment.\n\nWe can be in rhythm with the universe 365 days a year\u2014in spring, summer, autumn, and winter\u2014and manifest the life force, wisdom, and good fortune that enables us to surmount any problem or suffering. When we rev up the powerful engine of life force that is Buddhahood, we can break through any impasse and keep moving forward, boldly steering ourselves in the direction of hope and justice.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth, published in Japanese in March 1999.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.12]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.14]"}, {"title": "chapter-3-14.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.14]\n3.14 Polishing Our Lives through Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\nPresident Ikeda discusses the benefits of our daily practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and reciting portions of the Lotus Sutra.\nThe Mystic Law is the key to polishing our lives. In \u201cOn Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,\u201d Nichiren Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cThis is similar to a tarnished mirror that will shine like a jewel when polished. A mind now clouded by the illusions of the innate darkness of life is like a tarnished mirror, but when polished, it is sure to become like a clear mirror, reflecting the essential nature of phenomena [Dharma nature] and the true aspect of reality. Arouse deep faith, and diligently polish your mirror day and night. How should you polish it? Only by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.\u201d (WND-1, 4)\n\nOur society today is rife with negative influences. People\u2019s lives are easily clouded and sullied. That is why we need this fundamental method for polishing and purifying our lives.\n\nA life that has been thoroughly polished by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo shines with wisdom, and this wisdom serves as a beacon guiding the way to victory in life. In \u201cThe Benefits of the Teacher of the Law\u201d chapter of the Lotus Sutra, the wisdom of those who uphold the Mystic Law is likened to \u201ca pure bright mirror / in which forms and shapes are all reflected\u201d (LSOC19, 303). Just as a bright, clear mirror reflects every object as it is, a life that has been well polished can discern the true reality of all things in the world.\n\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, Nichiren Daishonin comments on this passage as follows:\n\n\u201cThe sutra passage is saying that persons whose six sense organs are pure will be like lapis lazuli or like bright mirrors in which one sees the major world system (or the thousand-millionfold world).*1\n\n\u201cNow when Nichiren and his followers chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, they see and understand the ten thousand phenomena [i.e., all phenomena], as though these were reflected in a bright mirror.\u201d (OTT, 149)\n\nLapis lazuli is one of the seven kinds of treasures.*2 The purification of the six sense organs*3 is one of the benefits achieved by practitioners of the Mystic Law that is outlined in the \u201cBenefits of the Teacher of the Law\u201d chapter. In other words, through Buddhist practice, we purify and enhance our mental and perceptual faculties as represented by our eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind\u2014that is, our life in its entirety.\n\nThe \u201cbright mirror\u201d of a well-forged and polished life fully reflects the universe, society, and human life. The \u201cbright mirror,\u201d fundamentally, is the Gohonzon\u2014in other words, the life of Nichiren Daishonin. In a broader sense, it is the \u201cbright mirror of the single mind [of faith]\u201d (cf. OTT, 149) of all those who believe in the Gohonzon as disciples of the Daishonin.\n\nThis is the profound significance of faith in the Mystic Law. Through strong faith, we can elevate and transform our lives\u2014spiritually and physically\u2014to their purest and strongest possible state. The purification of our lives through faith is the driving force for our victory as human beings. That is why it is vital for us to persevere in faith until the very end of our lives.\n\nFrom a speech at an Arts Division general meeting, Tokyo, May 10, 1987.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Major world system: Also, thousand-millionfold world. One of the world systems described in ancient Indian cosmology.\n*2Seven kinds of treasures: Also, the seven treasures. Seven precious substances. The list differs among the Buddhist scriptures. In the Lotus Sutra, the seven are gold, silver, lapis lazuli, seashell, agate, pearl, and carnelian.\n*3Purification of the six sense organs: Also, purification of the six senses. This refers to the six sense organs of eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind becoming pure, making it possible to apprehend all things correctly.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.13]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.15]"}, {"title": "chapter-3-15.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.15]\n3.15 Change Starts from Prayer\nReferring to the Daishonin\u2019s writings, President Ikeda discusses the profound significance of prayer in Nichiren Buddhism.\nNichiren Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cThe prayers offered by a practitioner of the Lotus Sutra will be answered just as an echo answers a sound, as a shadow follows a form, as the reflection of the moon appears in clear water, as a mirror collects dewdrops,*1 as a magnet attracts iron, as amber attracts particles of dust, or as a clear mirror reflects the color of an object.\u201d (WND-1, 340)\n\nIn this passage, the Daishonin states that the prayers of the votary of the Lotus Sutra are always answered. His use of natural principles and phenomena as analogies demonstrates his strong confidence in what he is saying.\n\nWherever practitioners of the Lotus Sutra chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, just as an echo answers a sound and a shadow follows a form, their prayers will unfailingly produce positive results there. The Daishonin teaches that our lives are transformed\u2014both spiritually and physically\u2014by prayer, which in turn exerts a positive influence on our environment.\n\nPrayer is not something abstract. Many today may regard the intangible, unseen realm of life as nothing more than a product of the imagination. But if we were to view things only from a material perspective, then our relationships with people and things would largely appear to arise solely from the chaos of randomness. The penetrating insight of Buddhism, however, discerns the Law of life in the depths of chaos and apprehends it as the force that supports and activates all phenomena from within.\n\nThe Daishonin writes: \u201cAs life does not go beyond the moment, the Buddha expounded the blessings that come from a single moment of rejoicing [on hearing the Lotus Sutra]\u201d (WND-1, 62). Because \u201clife does not go beyond the moment,\u201d as he says, our focus should be on the power that emerges from within us at each moment to support us and give fundamental direction to our lives. Prayer\u2014namely, chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u2014is the only way for us to confront on this fundamental level the delusions inherent in life.\n\nIt thus follows that prayer is the driving force for maintaining a correct practice and tenacious action. Nothing is as insubstantial as action without prayer. For those who neglect prayer, things may appear to go quite smoothly for a while. They may even seem very upbeat. But once faced with adversity, they tend to fall into despair, their lives as fragile as a withered tree. Lacking self-mastery, they are tossed about like leaves on the turbulent waters of society.\n\nThe path up the hill of life doesn\u2019t follow a straight line. There are successes and mistakes. Sometimes we win and sometimes we lose. With each step on our way, with every curve and corner we navigate, we grow a little bit more. In this process, prayer functions as a powerful force preventing us from becoming arrogant in victory or devastated by defeat.\n\nThat\u2019s why none are stronger than those who base themselves on prayer. Our strong, focused prayer manifests as the power of faith and practice, which in turn activates the power of the Buddha and the Law. The main player in this drama is always the human being\u2014it is we ourselves.\n\nPrayer produces a change within our hearts, within the depths of our lives. This profound, intangible inner change does not end with us alone [but inspires a similar change in others]. Likewise, when one community changes, it will not be limited to that community alone. Just as a single wave gives rise to countless others, change in one community will create a ripple effect of change in other communities as well.\n\nI wish to assert that the first step toward such social change is a change in the heart of a single individual.\n\nThis is also, I believe, where the deep significance of the Daishonin\u2019s statement that \u201cBuddhism is reason\u201d (WND-1, 839) lies.\n\nTo return to the passage from \u201cOn Prayer\u201d that we are studying, \u201csound,\u201d \u201cform,\u201d and \u201cclear water\u201d correspond to our attitude in prayer, while \u201cecho,\u201d \u201cshadow,\u201d and \u201creflection of the moon\u201d correspond to the natural way in which prayers are answered. Just as these three analogies refer to phenomena that arise in accord with natural principles, the prayers of a practitioner of the Lotus Sutra will also be definitely answered in accord with the inexorable Law of life and in accord with reason.\n\nPrayer in Nichiren Buddhism is free of all arrogance and conceit. The very act of sitting before the Gohonzon and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo pulses with the humble spirit to transcend attachment to one\u2019s own shallow wisdom and limited experience to become one with the Law of life and the fundamental rhythm of nature and the universe, which were revealed through the Buddha\u2019s enlightened wisdom. Without being self-abasing, we concentrate all our actions into a single life moment\u2014into our determined prayer\u2014while recharging our lives to prepare for boundless, vibrant growth. That is the healthiest and most fulfilling state of life.\n\nLet us chant to the Gohonzon about all of our problems in life and challenge them.\n\nPrayer is essential. Let\u2019s never forget that everything starts from prayer. If we lose sight of prayer and fail to transform our lives in actuality, then even the most eloquent speeches and high-minded arguments will all be just empty theory, pipe dreams, and illusions. Faith and the Soka Gakkai spirit, too, arise from praying strongly and deeply about our actual situations and realities.\n\nIn the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism, prayer by itself isn\u2019t enough. Just as an arrow flying toward its target contains the full power and strength of the archer who shot it, our prayer contains all of our efforts and actions. Prayer without action is just wishful thinking, and action without prayer will be unproductive.\n\nI therefore would like to point out that lofty prayer arises from a lofty sense of responsibility. Serious prayer will not arise from an irresponsible or careless attitude toward work, daily living, and life itself. Those who take responsibility for every part of their lives and give their all in every endeavor will make a habit of prayer.\n\nFrom a lecture on Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s writing \u201cOn Prayer,\u201d published in the Seikyo Shimbun, October 22, 1977.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Vapor condenses on a mirror placed outside at night.

It goes without saying that it is preferable to have the note with the greater value. In the case of daimoku, the important thing is to chant earnestly and with strong conviction. Of course, it would be even better to have lots of 100,000-lira notes! The bottom line is that both quality and quantity matter in chanting.\n\nThe principle of \u201cresponsive communion\u201d is very important in Nichiren Buddhism. To use an analogy, when talking on the phone, if the connection is good, we\u2019ll be heard even if we speak softly, but if it\u2019s bad, then sometimes the other person won\u2019t be able to hear us even if we shout. In order for our prayers to be effective, we need to express them honestly and directly to the Gohonzon.\n\nThe Daishonin states: \u201cWhat is called faith is nothing unusual\u201d (WND-1, 1036). In other words, we can just be ourselves. He continues:\n\n\u201cFaith means putting one\u2019s trust in the Lotus Sutra, Shakyamuni, Many Treasures, the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions, and the heavenly gods and benevolent deities, and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo as a woman cherishes her husband, as a man lays down his life for his wife, as parents refuse to abandon their children, or as a child refuses to leave its mother.\u201d (WND-1, 1036)\n\nWe should be honest and unpretentious when we chant to the Gohonzon. If we are suffering or feeling sad, then we should take that suffering to the Gohonzon without hiding it, expressing in our prayers what is in our hearts.\n\nIt is the Daishonin\u2019s wish that we all become happy. By coming in contact with and connecting with the life of the Daishonin [by chanting to the Gohonzon], therefore, we are certain to attain happiness. It is inconceivable that the Daishonin would fail to protect those who are striving as his emissaries to realize kosen-rufu.\n\nEssentially, we practice the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism for our own happiness and well-being. In chanting daimoku, too, the main thing is that we ourselves feel happy and satisfied. It\u2019s not a matter of formality; there are no rules specifying how long we have to chant and so on. While it is often helpful to set ourselves a target for the amount of daimoku we want to chant, when we\u2019re too tired or sleepy, or we find ourselves dozing off in front of the Gohonzon and just chanting out of force of habit, then it is far more valu\u00acable to get some rest and chant properly another time, when we\u2019re refreshed in body and mind.\n\nThe most important thing is that we are filled with a satisfying sense of revitalization after chanting. When we continue chanting in this way each day, we will naturally come to experience a life in which all our desires are fulfilled.\n\nFrom a question-and-answer session during a North Italy representative leaders meeting, Italy, July 3, 1992.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.15]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.17]"}, {"title": "chapter-3-17.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.17]\n3.17 Chanting with Unwavering Conviction\nPresident Ikeda responds to the question of a member who asked: \u201cWhen we were chanting daimoku together with you earlier, the desire and courage to realize my dreams came welling forth from my life. How can I chant with this kind of feeling and live with courage all the time?\u201d\nEven one daimoku can pervade the entire universe. Truly heartfelt and determined daimoku, therefore, has the power to move everything.\n\nTo illustrate, the words \u201cI love you\u201d can have a completely different impact depending on whether they are said from the heart or merely as an empty gesture.\n\nDaimoku chanted with the deep conviction that one\u2019s life is the entity of the Mystic Law, or with the resolve to dedicate one\u2019s life to spreading the Mystic Law as an emissary of the Buddha, cannot fail to resonate with the Gohonzon or reach the universe. A person who chants in this way will definitely attain a state of complete freedom.\n\nOf course, no one becomes an expert in anything right away. It is by overcoming obstacles again and again and continuing to press forward that we gain a degree of expertise or mastery in a given field.\n\nThe same holds true for faith. There may be times when we give in to self-defeat and our determination wanes, or when things don\u2019t go as we\u2019d hoped and we begin to feel anxious or fearful. But the important thing is to continue chanting daimoku, no matter what. Whether our prayers are answered right away or not, we must keep chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, without harboring any doubts. Those who maintain such faith will eventually attain the supreme path and highest pinnacle of value, and savor the conviction that everything unfolded in the very best and most meaningful way. They will build immensely fulfilling lives and come to regard everything as a source of joy and a part of their mission. Such are the workings of the Mystic Law and the power of faith.\n\nWhy is the Gohonzon important? Because, through having faith in it, we can bring forth the Gohonzon, or the state of Buddhahood, that is inherent in our own lives. The Daishonin states that the Gohonzon is found only in the faith of each one of us (cf. WND-1, 832).\n\nWe ourselves and all human beings are worthy of respect because every single individual is an entity of the Mystic Law. The Gohonzon is important above all because it enables us to manifest the Mystic Law that exists within us.\n\nFrom a question-and-answer session during a North Italy representative leaders meeting, Italy, July 3, 1992.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.16]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.18]"}, {"title": "chapter-3-18.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.18]\n3.18 Developing a Strong Inner Core\nPresident Ikeda responds to the concern of a Future Division member who was failing to make any headway in solving a difficult problem even after having decided to challenge it by earnestly doing gongyo every day.\nIn Nichiren Buddhism, it is said that no prayer goes unanswered. But this is very different from having every wish instantly gratified as if by magic. If you chant to win the lottery tomorrow, or score 100 percent on a test tomorrow without having studied, the odds are small that it will happen. Nonetheless, viewed from a deeper, longer-term perspective, all your prayers serve to propel you in the direction of happiness.\n\nSometimes our immediate prayers are realized, and sometimes they aren\u2019t. When we look back later, however, we can say with absolute conviction that everything turned out for the best.\n\nBuddhism accords with reason. Our faith is manifested in our daily lives, in our actual circumstances. Our prayers cannot be answered if we fail to make efforts to realize them.\n\nFurthermore, it takes a great deal of time and effort to overcome sufferings of a karmic nature, whose roots lie deep in causes we made in the past. There is a big difference, for example, in the time it takes for a scratch to heal and that required to recover from a serious internal disease. Some illnesses can be treated with medication, while others require surgery. The same applies to changing our karma through faith and practice.\n\nIn addition, each person\u2019s level of faith and individual karma differ. By chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, however, we can bring forth a powerful sense of hope and move our lives in a positive, beneficial direction without fail.\n\nIt\u2019s unrealistic to think we can achieve anything of substance overnight. If we were to have every prayer answered instantly, it would lead to our ruin. We\u2019d grow lazy and complacent.\n\nYou may have a passing interest in painting, for example. But if you think you can simply dash off some paintings, suddenly hold an exhibition and have your work snapped up by art collectors, you are hardly being realistic.\n\nSuppose you spend all your money playing rather than working, and are now destitute. Do you think someone giving you a large sum of money would contribute to your happiness in the long term?\n\nIt would be like making superficial repairs to a crumbling building without addressing the root problem. To create something fine and solid, it would be better to build anew from the foundation up. The purpose of our Buddhist practice is to transform our lives on a fundamental level, not superficially. It enables us to develop a strong inner core and solidly accumulate indestructible good fortune.\n\nThere are two kinds of benefit that derive from faith in the Gohonzon: conspicuous and inconspicuous. Conspicuous benefit is the obvious, visible benefit of being protected or being quickly able to surmount a problem when it arises\u2014be it an illness or a conflict in personal relationships.\n\nInconspicuous benefit, on the other hand, is less tangible. It is good fortune accumulated slowly but steadily, like the growth of a tree or the rising of the tide, which results in the forging of a rich and expansive state of life. We might not discern any change from day to day, but as the years pass, it will be clear that we\u2019ve become happy, that we\u2019ve grown as individuals. This is inconspicuous benefit.\n\nWhen you chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, you will definitely gain the best result, regardless of whether that benefit is conspicuous or inconspicuous.\n\nNo matter what happens, the important thing is to continue chanting. If you do so, you\u2019ll become happy without fail. Even if things don\u2019t work out the way you hoped or imagined, when you look back later, you\u2019ll understand on a much more profound level that it was the best possible result. This is tremendous inconspicuous benefit.\n\nConspicuous benefit, for instance, might allow you to eat your fill today but leave you worrying about your next meal. As an example of inconspicuous benefit, on the other hand, you may have only a meager meal today, but you are moving steadily toward a life in which you will never have to worry about having enough to eat. The latter is a far more attractive prospect, I think, and is the essence of practicing Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth, published in Japanese in March 1999.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.17]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.19]"}, {"title": "chapter-3-19.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.19]\n3.19 Faith Is a Lifelong Pursuit\nPresident Ikeda responds to the concern of a Future Division member who said she feels guilty when she misses gongyo.\nAs long as we have faith in the Gohonzon, we are not going to suffer punishment or negative consequences from missing gongyo, so please put your mind at ease. Nichiren Daishonin says that chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo even once is a source of limitless benefit. So imagine the immense benefit you will accumulate when you continue earnestly to do gongyo and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo morning and evening. It is something we do for our own sake; it is a right, not an obligation.\n\nThe Gohonzon will never demand that you chant to it. Having appreciation for being able to chant to the Gohonzon is the heart of faith. The more you exert yourselves in faith\u2014in doing gongyo and chanting daimoku\u2014the more you stand to gain.\n\nAlso, Nichiren Daishonin writes nothing about the specific amount of daimoku we should chant. It is entirely up to each individual\u2019s awareness. Faith is a lifelong pursuit, so there\u2019s no need to be unnecessarily nervous or anxious about how much you chant.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to put unnecessary pressure on yourselves. Buddhism exists to free people, not to restrain them. Chanting every day, even a little bit, is important. For instance, the food you eat each day turns into energy that fuels your bodies. Your studies, too, become a valuable asset when you make steady efforts on a daily basis.\n\nOur lives are created from what we do and how we live every day. For that reason, we should strive to live each day so as to continually improve ourselves. The driving force for this is our morning and evening gongyo.\n\nExerting ourselves in the practice of gongyo each day amounts to what we might call a \u201cspiritual workout.\u201d It purifies our lives, gets our \u201cmotors\u201d running, and sets us on the right track. It gets our bodies and our minds moving and sets a good rhythm for the day.\n\nIt is important to have the spirit to sit down in front of the Gohonzon. The spirit to keep challenging yourself to pray before the Gohonzon every day, to chant daimoku, even if only little, is truly admirable.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth, published in Japanese in March 1999.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.18]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.20]"}, {"title": "chapter-3-20.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.20]\n3.20 The Universal Language of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas\nPresident Ikeda responds to a question from a member about the effectiveness of reciting passages from the Lotus Sutra and chanting daimoku in a language one doesn\u2019t understand.\nI would like to address the question of whether there is any value in reciting sutra passages and chanting daimoku without understanding their meaning.\n\nOf course, it is better if you understand their meaning. That will strengthen your faith in the Mystic Law. But if you understand and yet fail to practice, it won\u2019t get you anywhere. Moreover, you cannot understand all of the profound significance of the Law through reason alone.\n\nBirds and dogs, for example, have their own language, their own speech. People do not understand it, but other birds and dogs do. There are many comparable examples among humans as well\u2014codes, abbreviations, or foreign languages that are comprehended by experts or native speakers but unintelligible to others. Married couples also sometimes have their own language that only they understand!\n\nIn the same way, the language of gongyo and daimoku reaches the Gohonzon and the realms of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions and three existences. We might call it the language of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas. That is why our voices reciting the sutra and chanting daimoku before the Gohonzon reach all Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and heavenly deities, whether we understand what we are saying or not. They hear it and say in response, \u201cExcellent, excellent!\u201d rejoicing and praising us. The entire universe envelops us in the light of happiness.\n\nNichiren Daishonin teaches that through reciting the sutra and chanting daimoku, we can reach an elevated state of life in which, while engaged in our daily activities, we freely traverse the cosmos. In \u201cReply to Sairen-bo,\u201d the Daishonin writes: \u201cThose who are our disciples and lay supporters can view Eagle Peak in India and day and night will go to and from the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light that has existed for all time. What a truly inexpressible joy it is!\u201d (WND-1, 313).\n\nWhen we chant before the Gohonzon, the door to our inner microcosm instantly opens to the macrocosm of the entire universe, and we savor a serene and boundless happiness, as if gazing out over the entire cosmos. We feel a deep fulfillment and joy along with a feeling of supreme confidence and self-mastery, as if we hold everything in the palm of our hands. The microcosm enfolded by the macrocosm reaches out to enfold the macrocosm in its own embrace.\n\nThe Daishonin writes in \u201cLetter to Niike\u201d: \u201cWhen nurtured by the chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, . . . [we] are free to soar into the sky of the true aspect of all phenomena\u201d (WND-1, 1030).\n\nIn \u201cOn Offerings for Deceased Ancestors,\u201d he also says: \u201cThough he himself is like the wisteria vine, because he clings to the pine that is the Lotus Sutra, he is able to ascend the mountain of perfect enlightenment. Because he has the wings of the single vehicle [Mystic Law] to rely upon, he can soar into the sky of Tranquil Light [Buddhahood]\u201d (WND-1, 821).\n\nJust as we might climb the highest mountain peak to gaze down on the bright, clear scene of the world below, we can climb the mountain of perfect enlightenment, or supreme wisdom, the Daishonin says. We can attain a state of eternal bliss, experiencing moment after moment the infinite expanse and depth of life, as if soaring through the universe and savoring the sight of myriad beautiful stars, blazing comets, and glittering galaxies.\n\nFrom a speech at an SGI-USA youth training session, U.S.A., February 20, 1990.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.19]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.1]"}, {"title": "chapter-4-1.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.1]\n4.1 Living with an Awareness of the Importance of the Heart\nOur inner transformation through revealing our inherent Buddhahood will transform not only our own lives, but also our environment and the entire world. President Ikeda has always stressed this philosophy for achieving unshakable happiness, and this chapter introduces many important teachings on that subject.\nI was talking with someone yesterday, and our conversation turned to the question of what is the ultimate message of Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s writings. We concluded that the first essential message is to base ourselves on the Gohonzon. It is to make the foundation of our faith \u201conly Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u201d (WND-1, 903)\u2014that is, to sincerely chant and practice the Mystic Law alone. The second essential message is that \u201cIt is the heart that is important\u201d (WND-1, 1000). These two points, we agreed, are the crucial cornerstones of the Daishonin\u2019s writings.\n\nThe reason why the second is important is that faith is not just a matter of embracing the Gohonzon and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, but also a matter of our heart, or the attitude with which we practice. Is our heart directed toward kosen-rufu? Our innermost heart, the attitude in the depths of our being, determines everything.\n\nWhether we become happy, attain enlightenment, move in the direction of Buddhahood, or wind up in a state of suffering\u2014everything is the exact result of the wondrous workings of our heart or mind. This point cannot be overemphasized.\n\nJust like us, the universe, too, has a nonmaterial aspect. Our heart of faith is communicated to the universe. The workings of our heart or mind are truly amazing.\n\nSelfishness, complaint, doubt, deviousness, conceit, arrogance, and so forth are all causes of unhappiness for both ourselves and others. When we allow ourselves to be ruled by such negative attitudes, we are like a plane that has lost its direction in a heavy fog. We can see nothing clearly. The distinction between good and bad, right and wrong, becomes blurred. We plunge not only ourselves but our passengers\u2014our friends and others around us\u2014into misery.\n\nWhen afflicted by arrogance, our minds run amok, like a crazed horse galloping wildly in circles, unable to stop, until we lose all self-awareness and do harm to those around us. This is not a normal human state. And though we may think ourselves better than others, the exact opposite is true. In fact, in Buddhism, the conceited and arrogant are the most dangerous people.\n\nIn contrast, a sincere concern for others, a dedicated commitment to our beliefs, a sense of responsibility toward fulfilling our mission for kosen-rufu, a wish to wholeheartedly encourage and support our fellow members, a feeling of appreciation, gratitude, and joy\u2014these attitudes are causes that will produce boundless good fortune, not only for ourselves but also for our family and loved ones as well as our descendants. They give rise to strong protection by the heavenly deities\u2014the positive forces of the universe\u2014and enable us to advance directly along the path to attaining Buddhahood.\n\nLet us therefore live with the Daishonin\u2019s words \u201cIt is the heart that is important\u201d engraved deeply and indelibly in our lives.\n\nFrom a speech at a divisional representatives conference, Tokyo, February 25, 1988.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 3: The Practice for Transforming Our State of Life [3.20]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.2]"}, {"title": "chapter-4-2.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.2]\n4.2 Appreciation and Joy Multiply Our Good Fortune\nRejecting negativity and practicing faith based on appreciation and joy is the way to elevate our life state.\n\u201cIt is the heart that is important\u201d (WND-1, 1000), writes the Daishonin.\n\nWhen we do something, do we approach it with a negative attitude\u2014grumbling, \u201cOh, not again! I hate this!\u201d\u2014or a positive attitude\u2014telling ourselves brightly, \u201cAll right, here\u2019s a fresh opportunity to gain good fortune!\u201d?\n\nThis seemingly small, subtle difference in attitude can make a huge difference in our lives. It can change things 180 degrees. This is what the Lotus Sutra and the doctrine of \u201cthree thousand realms in a single moment of life\u201d*1 teach us.\n\nThe heart is invisible, and Buddhism provides a comprehensive understanding of the principles governing that invisible heart. It represents the highest form of psychology, neuroscience, and psychotherapy.\n\nAppreciation and joy multiply our good fortune. Complaint and negativity erase it.\n\nIn the endeavor to spread Nichiren Buddhism, actions arising from our sincere wish to help others and teach them the greatness of the Mystic Law bring immense benefit and good fortune to fill our lives.\n\n\u201cIt is the heart that is important\u201d\u2014there are no truer words than these.\n\nHuman beings are weak and easily susceptible to complaint, resentment, envy, and discouragement.\n\nBut this is where those who practice Nichiren Buddhism differ. They stop complaining, they stop being dissatisfied and negative. They attain an inner strength that makes them confident and positive. And their hearts overflow with appreciation and gratitude.\n\nWe often find that those who live in the city yearn for country life, while those who live in the country long for city life, or that those who are single dream of being married, while those who are married wish they were single again. That is a common tendency of the human heart.\n\nBut happiness doesn\u2019t lie somewhere far away. It is something we must achieve for ourselves through our present struggles in the here and now.\n\nWhen we have a positive and appreciative attitude toward our communities, it will give greater confidence and impetus to our activities. The joy of kosen-rufu will spread.\n\nFrom a speech at a Kyushu and Okinawa joint conference, Okinawa, March 3, 1998.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Three thousand realms in a single moment of life (Jpn. ichinen-sanzen): A philosophical system established by the Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai of China based on the Lotus Sutra. The \u201cthree thousand realms\u201d indicates the varying aspects that life assumes at each moment. At each moment, life manifests one of the Ten Worlds. Each of these worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself, thus making one hundred possible worlds. Each of these hundred worlds possesses the ten factors and operates within each of the three realms of existence, thus making three thousand realms. In other words, all phenomena are contained within a single moment of life, and a single moment of life permeates the three thousand realms of existence, or the entire phenomenal world.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.1]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.3]"}, {"title": "chapter-4-3.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.3]\n4.3 Those Who Smile Are Strong\nPresident Ikeda urges us to regard difficulties as opportunities for attaining happiness and to lead positive, upbeat lives, creating hope where there is none.\nPracticing Nichiren Buddhism doesn\u2019t mean that we are immune to life\u2019s problems. The storms of karma appear in many unexpected ways\u2014as problems at home, at work, with our children, and so on.\n\nBut with each challenge we overcome, we carry out our human revolution and transform the destiny of our families and loved ones. In fact, trying times are opportunities to make a leap forward to greater happiness.\n\nLife is long. Sometimes we will succeed, and sometimes we won\u2019t. There is no need to be embarrassed by a temporary setback. The important thing is to triumph in the end, to never lose our fighting spirit, no matter how difficult the situation.\n\nThose who remain positive and cheerful in adversity are truly strong.\n\nWhen I visited the Gandhi Smriti and Darshan Samiti [in 1992]\u2014the national memorial to Mahatma Gandhi in New Delhi\u2014there was a large portrait of Gandhi on the wall. His wide, toothless grin conveyed an unaffected sense of humor and enjoyment.\n\nOne museum official told me that while many of the photographs of Gandhi shown abroad usually depict him with a serious, even stern expression, actually he was a person who laughed and smiled a lot. The official commented that Gandhi always said he would never have been able to survive his long and bitter struggle if he didn\u2019t have a good sense of humor.\n\nGandhi endured immeasurable persecution and suffering in his struggle for India\u2019s independence, but he was always smiling.\n\nThose who can smile are strong. Those who lead good, positive lives are always bright and upbeat.\n\nIf you always seem stressed and gloomy, you\u2019ll bring down everyone else around you. You can\u2019t inspire or invigorate others that way. Precisely when things are tough, that\u2019s the time to encourage those around you with a bright smile.\n\nIf the situation seems hopeless, create hope. Don\u2019t depend on others. Ignite the flame of hope within your own heart.\n\nFrom Nijuisseiki e no haha to ko o kataru (Dialogue on Mothers and Children in the 21st Century), vol. 3, published in Japanese in June 2000.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.2]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.4]"}, {"title": "chapter-4-4.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.4]\n4.4 Polishing Our Hearts to Shine like Diamonds\nOur hearts will not shine unless we polish them. When we exert ourselves in faith and polish our hearts like diamonds, we attain a state of genuine happiness.\nWhat is the purpose of our Buddhist practice? It is for all of us, without exception, to become happy. That is also the purpose of our organization for kosen-rufu. Those who steadfastly uphold the Mystic Law will never be unhappy. It is important to have absolute confidence in this. That confidence, that conviction, will generate immense good fortune.\n\nBuddhism teaches the four sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death. Our bright, hope-filled members in the Future Division and young men\u2019s and young women\u2019s divisions will also eventually grow old. The sufferings of sickness and death, too, are inescapable parts of life. Will you lead a life shining with solid happiness, accumulating ever more benefit and good fortune as you grow older? Or will you lead a life characterized by frustration and disappointment, growing sadder and lonelier with the passing years?\n\nThe Mystic Law embodies the principle that \u201cthe sufferings of birth and death are nirvana.\u201d It enables us to be eternally youthful and vibrant, always bringing forth hope and actualizing our dreams.\n\nThe Mystic Law embodies the principle that \u201cearthly desires are enlightenment.\u201d The more numerous our problems, the more we can expand our life state based on faith and make those problems the fuel for our happiness. We can positively transform everything, changing poison into medicine.\n\nThe time of youth, in particular, is fraught with problems and worries. But that\u2019s how it should be. You can\u2019t become great leaders without experiencing problems or making effort. Through effort and hard work, you strengthen yourself and grow.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cIt is the heart that is important\u201d (WND-1, 1000).\n\nThose who have diamond-like hearts of faith are radiant champions who enjoy an indestructible, diamond-like state of happiness. They are eternal victors. Wherever they go, wherever they dwell, is a royal palace. They enjoy a vast and lofty state of life, as if gazing serenely over the entire universe.\n\nBy contrast, there are those who, though giving the appearance of being fine and upstanding, are actually morally corrupt and dishonest.\n\nWe need to polish the diamond of our faith. A raw gemstone only sparkles when it is polished. The diamond of our faith is polished by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and working for kosen-rufu. A life dedicated to the mission of advancing kosen-rufu will unfailingly enter a path of enduring happiness\u2014a wonderful state of constant joy.\n\nOur Buddhist practice enables us to attain a vast and expansive state of life in which we can accept whatever happens with courage and joy, and keep moving positively forward.\n\nFrom a speech at a Thai commemorative representatives conference, Thailand, February 2, 1992.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.3]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.5]"}, {"title": "chapter-4-5.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.5]\n4.5 Mastering Our Minds\nTo effect a major transformation of our life state, we must free ourselves from the domination of our vacillating, weak mind; we must become the master of our mind, and live accordingly.\n\u201cIt is the heart that is important\u201d (WND-1, 1000). The heart, the mind, is truly wondrous and unfathomable. The inner realm of life is boundless. We can also deepen it infinitely.\n\nThe mind can give rise to a life state of great joy, as if soaring freely and effortlessly through the vast blue sky. It can radiate compassion like the clear, bright, all-illuminating sunshine and warmly embrace those who are suffering. It can tremble with righteous anger and vanquish evil and injustice with the courage and ferocity of a lion. The mind is constantly changing, like an ever-unfolding drama or shifting panorama.\n\nAnd the most wondrous thing about the mind is that it can manifest the world of Buddhahood. Even those beset by the deepest delusion and suffering can bring forth in the depths of their lives the state of Buddhahood that is one with the universe. This momentous drama of transformation is indeed the greatest of all wonders.\n\nBuddhism recognizes the supreme nobility and potential for phenomenal transformation inherent within the lives of all people. Based on that, Nichiren Daishonin taught that by thoroughly polishing their lives through chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, anyone\u2014no matter how steeped in ignorance and delusion\u2014can reveal their Buddhahood and transform even the most evil and defiled land into a pure land.\n\nMyoho-renge-kyo is the \u201cmystic truth that is originally inherent in all living beings\u201d*1 (WND-1, 3).\n\nAnd that is why, through our practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we can polish the tarnished mirror of \u201ca mind now clouded by the illusions of the innate darkness of life\u201d into \u201ca clear mirror, reflecting the essential nature of phenomena*2 and the true aspect of reality\u201d (WND-1, 4), and thus reveal our inner Buddhahood. In other words, we can manifest the \u201coriginally inherent mystic truth\u201d (cf. WND-1, 3) and open the infinite potential that resides within us.\n\nMyoho-renge-kyo is the Law inherent in our own lives. The moment-to-moment inner transformation we achieve through chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo leads not only to a fundamental change in our mind-set, but to a change in the entire way we live our lives, putting us on track to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime. And it further creates a groundswell for the great transformation of all humankind that is kosen-rufu. Myoho-renge-kyo is the dynamic pulse of change in all spheres.\n\nThe fact that Myoho-renge-kyo is the Law inherent within our lives raises another issue we must consider: that is, the relationship between the mind of delusion\u2014a mind clouded by innate darkness\u2014and the mind of enlightenment, or \u201cmyo\u201d\u2014a mind illuminated by the essential nature of phenomena and the true aspect of reality.\n\nIf we simply follow our easily swayed, unenlightened minds, our potential will quickly wither away. Or, even worse, we may give in to negative and destructive impulses. Such is the subtle nature of the workings of the mind. Because our minds are the key to attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime, we must overcome our own inner weaknesses. This is what our Buddhist practice is all about.\n\nThe deluded minds of ordinary people are always vacillating. We must not make this constantly changing, shifting mind our basis or guide. This is the meaning of the well-known sutra passage: \u201cBecome the master of your mind rather than let your mind master you\u201d*3 (WND-1, 502).\n\nThe Daishonin cites this passage about becoming the master of one\u2019s mind in many places in his writings, offering it as an important guideline for his followers. Becoming the master of one\u2019s mind means having a sound compass in life and the bright beacon of faith.\n\nWe must not let ourselves be mastered by our unenlightened minds that change and shift according to the circumstances. We need a teacher, or mentor, to help guide our minds in the right direction. In that sense, the true masters of the mind are the Buddhist Law and the teachings of the Buddha. Shakyamuni vowed to make the Law to which he had become enlightened the master or guide of his mind, and he took pride in living true to that vow. This is to live one\u2019s life \u201crelying on the Law,\u201d which Shakyamuni emphasized in his final injunction to his disciples before he died.\n\nTo allow ourselves to be mastered by our minds is to make ourselves, our selfish impulses, our foundation. Ultimately, we will be pulled this way and that by our ever-moving minds, succumb to egoism, and sink into the depths of darkness or ignorance.\n\nConversely, to master our minds means to make the Law our foundation.\n\nA teacher or mentor in Buddhism is one who leads and connects people to the Law, teaching them that the Law on which they should depend exists within their own lives. The disciples in turn seek the mentor, who embodies and is one with the Law. Looking to the mentor as a model, they exert themselves in their Buddhist practice. In this way, they lead a life that allows them to master their minds.\n\nIn other words, the existence of a mentor\u2014one who embodies and lives in accord with the Law and teaches people about their vast inner potential\u2014is indispensable for attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime.\n\nI am who I am today because of my mentor, second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda, who practiced in accord with the Buddha\u2019s teachings and dedicated his life to widely propagating Nichiren Buddhism in the modern age. Mr. Toda is always with me as my spiritual mentor. I still carry on a dialogue with my mentor in my heart, every moment, every day. This is the spirit of oneness of mentor and disciple.\n\nThose who always hold fast to their spiritual mentor as their model and compass and exert themselves as that mentor teaches are people who live based on the Law. Nichiren Buddhism is a teaching grounded in the oneness of mentor and disciple.\n\nFrom Lectures on \u201cOn Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,\u201d published in Japanese in January 2007.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1The mystic truth that is originally inherent in all living beings: This refers to the Mystic Law, or Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, which is inherent in all life.

WND-2, 342). The Daishonin responded with a stern rebuke:\n\n\u201cThe ruler of Japan is simply the chief of this island country. To speak as you do of being \u2018summoned\u2019 by persons who serve that ruler, of appearing before those \u2018in high position,\u2019 and of conducting yourself \u2018fittingly\u2019 is, however I consider it, in the end an insult to me, Nichiren!\u201d (WND-2, 342\u201343)\n\nThe account that Sammi-bo relayed to his mentor evinced no pride in being his disciple or practicing the supreme teaching of Buddhism. While making a superficial gesture of respecting the Daishonin, in his heart Sammi-bo fawned upon the powerful and, filled with self-importance, looked down on his mentor. He was arrogant, and the Daishonin keenly discerned this.\n\nThis is how Sammi-bo acted toward his mentor, who had done so much for him and taught him about the true essence of Buddhism. Sammi-bo was guided by self-interest, not by the teachings of his mentor. He was self-centered.\n\nArrogance is a form of ingratitude, and ingratitude is an ignorance of life\u2019s basic principles. Without such basic understanding, one cannot understand Buddhism. Arrogance, cowardice, and dishonesty\u2014these were Sammi-bo\u2019s essential qualities.\n\nThe Daishonin added even more sternly:\n\n\u201cIt would seem that Nichiren\u2019s disciples, after journeying to the capital [Kyoto], at first were careful not to forget their purpose, but later, led astray by the heavenly devil,*3 they lost their senses completely. . . .\n\n\u201cSo you [Sammi-bo] have gone to the capital, and before much time has passed you are changing your name [to sound more aristocratic], a piece of utter nonsense.\u201d (WND-2, 343)\n\nThe Daishonin laments over the vanity and foolishness of his disciple in moving in court circles, forgetting his original aspiration to seek the Buddha way, adopting a pretentious new name, and even changing his accent:\n\n\u201cNo doubt you have also changed your way of speaking and acquired the accent of the capital. Like a mouse that has changed into a bat but in fact is neither bird nor mouse, you are now neither a country priest nor a priest of the capital. You are behaving just like Sho-bo.*4\n\n\u201cYou should just go on speaking like a country person\u2014otherwise you will only sound ridiculous.\u201d (WND-2, 343)\n\nWith this one phrase about acquiring \u201cthe accent of the capital,\u201d the Daishonin exposed Sammi-bo\u2019s inner condition: enthralled by the glamour of the capital, he had been defeated by devilish functions.\n\nEventually, Sammi-bo renounced faith in the Daishonin\u2019s teachings, stopped practicing, and came to a sad end.\n\nThe Daishonin\u2019s great compassion led him to reflect later: \u201cIf I had scolded him [Sammi-bo] more strictly, he might have been saved\u201d (WND-1, 998). As this shows, sternly reprimanding those who succumb to arrogance is the proper approach, which requires firm compassion and accords precisely with the Daishonin\u2019s spirit.\n\nThe Daishonin boldly declared of himself: \u201cI am merely the son of a commoner from a remote province\u201d (WND-1, 1006). He affirmed that he was not of privileged birth or lineage, but of common birth. He was not ashamed of this, but proud.\n\nBecause he was born among the common people, he understood their hearts. If he had been born to privilege or high rank, he would have been shielded by the authorities and never experienced the harsh persecutions that marked his life. As a child of the common people, the Daishonin lived his life among them. He understood their sufferings as if they were his own and propagated his great teaching of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo to relieve those sufferings. Through his own life, he taught and exemplified the true way to realize kosen-rufu for future generations.\n\nMr. Toda declared that academic background has nothing to do with faith. Of course, he valued learning, but he warned that if individuals who think their education makes them better than others were to become Soka Gakkai leaders, people wouldn\u2019t follow them. With such leaders, members would only suffer.\n\nThe Daishonin\u2019s teachings are just and impartial. He cites the words, \u201cSince the Law is wonderful, the person is worthy of respect\u201d*5 (WND-1, 1097). And he writes: \u201cIf the Law that one embraces is supreme, then the person who embraces it must accordingly be foremost among all others\u201d (WND-1, 61).\n\nImportant are individuals who work for kosen-rufu. Those who persevere wholeheartedly to spread the Mystic Law in even the most trying times are truly admirable. Graduating from a famous university or having high social status has absolutely nothing to do with faith.\n\nAcademic credentials do not define greatness or intelligence. The eyes of Buddhism focus on the people themselves.\n\nFrom a speech at a Tokyo metropolitan area representatives conference, Tokyo, May 19, 2007.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Mount Hiei: The site of Enryaku-ji, the main temple of the Tendai (T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai) school and leading center of Buddhist studies in Japan at the time. It is located northeast of Kyoto, which was then the imperial capital.\n*2The phrase translated as \u201cconducted himself fittingly\u201d here suggests a self-congratulatory note of having done a good job and enhancing his reputation as a result.\n*3Heavenly devil: Also, devil king of the sixth heaven. The king of devils, who dwells in the highest or the sixth heaven of the world of desire. He is also named Freely Enjoying Things Conjured by Others, the king who makes free use of the fruits of others\u2019 efforts for his own pleasure. Served by innumerable minions, he obstructs Buddhist practice and delights in sapping the life force of other beings, the manifestation of the fundamental darkness or ignorance inherent in life. The devil king is a personification of the negative tendency to force others to one\u2019s will at any cost.\n*4 Sho-bo: Though originally a disciple of Nichiren Daishonin, he abandoned his faith in the Daishonin\u2019s teachings around the time of the Izu Exile in 1261 and eventually turned against his mentor. According to one account, he died around 1269.\n*5 T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai, The Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.5]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.7]"}, {"title": "chapter-4-7.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.7]\n4.7 When Our Life State Changes, the World around Us Changes\nThe Buddhist principle of inner transformation means that when we achieve the great life state of Buddhahood, we cause ourselves, those around us, and the place we are to shine.\nNichiren Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cHungry spirits perceive the Ganges River as fire, human beings perceive it as water, and heavenly beings perceive it as amrita.*1 Though the water is the same, it appears differently according to one\u2019s karmic reward from the past.\u201d (WND-1, 486)\n\nHow we perceive things differs according to our state of life. When our state of life changes, the realm in which we reside also changes. This is the essence of the doctrine of the \u201cactual three thousand realms in a single moment of life\u201d*2 found in the Lotus Sutra.\n\nReferring to the unending persecution he experienced throughout his life, the Daishonin says:\n\n\u201cDay after day, month after month, year after year I have been subjected to repeated persecutions. Minor persecutions and annoyances are too numerous even to be counted, but the major persecutions number four.\u201d*3(WND-1, 240)\n\nYet even while exiled to Sado Island, the harshest of his persecutions, he still serenely declares: \u201cI feel immeasurable delight even though I am now an exile\u201d (WND-1, 386). The Daishonin calmly gazes down on his situation from the lofty heights of a life condition as vast and boundless as the universe.\n\nSoka Gakkai founding president Tsunesaburo Makiguchi endured his wartime imprisonment for his beliefs with a similar state of mind, writing in letters from prison: \u201cWhat I am going through is nothing compared to the sufferings of the Daishonin on Sado\u201d;*4 and \u201cDepending on one\u2019s state of mind, even hell can be enjoyable.\u201d*5 This last sentence was censored and blacked out by the prosecutor.\n\nEstablishing such a towering state of life is the highest aim of humanity.\n\nA single flower can completely transform a bleak atmosphere. The important thing, therefore, is to have the spirit, the determination, to improve your environment, to change it for the better, if even just a little. Especially as practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism striving earnestly in faith, we cannot fail to vibrantly transform our lives. We will definitely enjoy happiness and prosperity. This is an unchanging principle of Buddhism.\n\nOur attitude changes everything. This is one of the great wonders of life, and at the same time, an undeniable reality.\n\nA proverb says: \u201cDo not complain that the rosebush has thorns, but rejoice that the thornbush has roses.\u201d Our perception changes depending on our outlook, becoming bright, beautiful, and expansive.\n\nNichiren Daishonin speaks of the \u201cwonderful workings of one mind\u201d (OTT, 30). The focused mind of faith in the Gohonzon has power and functions that are truly immense and wondrous. When the fundamental engine of our \u201cone mind\u201d\u2014our inner attitude, or resolve\u2014starts running, the gears of all phenomena of the three thousand realms are set in motion. Everything starts to change. We move everything in a bright and positive direction.\n\nWhen embraced by the great life state of Buddhahood, we ourselves, those around us, and the land in which we live will all shine with the light of happiness and hope. This is the power of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo of the \u201cactual three thousand realms in a single moment of life.\u201d At work here is the Buddhist principle of dynamic transformation.\n\nFrom Lectures on the \u201cExpedient Means\u201d and \u201cLife Span\u201d Chapters of the Lotus Sutra, vol. 3, published in Japanese in June 1996.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Amrita: A legendary, ambrosia-like liquid. In ancient India, it was regarded as the sweet-tasting beverage of the gods. In China, it was thought to rain down from heaven when the world became peaceful. Amrita is said to remove sufferings and give immortality. The word amrita means immortality and is often translated as sweet dew.\n*2Actual three thousand realms in a single moment of life: The doctrine of three thousand realms in a single moment of life, which is the fundamental teaching for attaining enlightenment, is classified into two as the theoretical principle and the actual embodiment of this principle. These are respectively termed \u201ctheoretical three thousand realms in a single moment of life\u201d and \u201cactual three thousand realms in a single moment of life.\u201d The theoretical principle is based on the theoretical teaching (first half) of the Lotus Sutra, while the actual principle is revealed in the essential teaching (latter half) of the Lotus Sutra. However, in the Latter Day of the Law, these are both theoretical; and the Law of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo that Nichiren Daishonin revealed is the actual teaching of three thousand realms in a single moment of life.\n*3The four major persecutions are: the Matsubagayatsu Persecution (1260), the Izu Exile (1261), the Komatsubara Persecution (1264), and the Tatsunokuchi Persecution and Sado Exile (1271).\n*4Translated from Japanese.

There are often cases where, for various reasons, we have to spend long periods of our lives in places we would rather not be. How do we deal with this? How do we lead a life of satisfaction and victory in a way that is true to ourselves in such situations? That is the challenge.\n\nAll too many respond to those kinds of circumstances by bewailing their misfortune, resenting their environment and the people in it to the end of their days. There are countless people like this in the world. There are also people who are driven to seek worldly success and honor and the praise and admiration of others. As long as such things remain their sole goals in life, they are bound to suffer endless dissatisfaction and anxiety.\n\nDesire has no limits, and as long as selfishness prevails, it is impossible to satisfy everyone. Not everyone in a company can be president.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s natural to make efforts to change and improve our environment and circumstances. But it\u2019s even more essential that we resolutely protect where we are now, our own \u201cfortress,\u201d or home ground, so to speak. We need to dedicate ourselves to our mission and, in that capacity, create a solid record of achievement in our own unique way.\n\nSome people are never in the limelight, never in a position to receive praise and recognition from others. But \u201cIt is the heart that is important\u201d (WND-1, 1000). A person\u2019s greatness is not determined by social status. Our happiness isn\u2019t determined by our environment. A vast universe exists in our hearts, in our lives. We practice Nichiren Buddhism to open up that boundless inner realm.\n\nWhen we open that magnificent realm of the spirit, we will be champions wherever we might be. We will savor without end the wondrous delights of a truly profound existence.\n\nMany people seek success and importance in the eyes of the world, but few aspire to become truly great human beings. Many wish to be showered with praise and attention, but few strive to build an inner happiness that will remain undiminished until the moment of their death and extend throughout the three existences of past, present, and future.\n\nDeath is the great final accounting of a person\u2019s life. Fame, wealth, social position, learning\u2014these in themselves are of no avail in the face of death. Death is a struggle faced with nothing but one\u2019s life itself, stripped of all worldly trappings. It is a solemn moment, at which victory or defeat is impartially determined. Those who win in this struggle are true victors.\n\nOur greatness and happiness as human beings are determined by the strength of our life force and our Buddhist faith and practice dedicated to kosen-rufu.\n\nWe are striving day after day for kosen-rufu, an unprecedented ideal in the history of humankind. It requires incredible perseverance and effort. Yet because of that, we are absolutely certain to build lives of true fulfillment.\n\nHow others view us is not important. Temporary successes or failures also do not matter. What counts is whether our faces shine with happy smiles at the very end of our lives. If we can look back and say, \u201cMy life was victorious. It was enjoyable. I have no regrets,\u201d then we are victors.\n\nYou, my friends in the youth division in particular, may now find yourselves in extremely trying and challenging situations. It may seem that impressive honors are beyond your reach. But that\u2019s fine. Just keep striving your hardest to realize your ideals, in the place of your personal mission. That\u2019s the way to build an eternally indestructible \u201cfortress\u201d of victory within your heart.\n\nFrom a speech at a leaders meeting, Tokyo, November 12, 1989.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.7]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.9]"}, {"title": "chapter-4-9.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.9]\n4.9 Nothing Is Ever Wasted in Buddhism\nWhen we dedicate ourselves to working for kosen-rufu, illness and every other form of adversity act as a tailwind helping us to establish a state of eternal happiness.\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, Nichiren Daishonin describes the workings of life as being \u201cstrict [without a single exception],\u201d adding that the three thousand realms, every single one of them, exist in our lives (cf. OTT, 22).\n\nNone of us can escape the strict law of cause and effect operating in our lives. That is a fact. The cumulative tally of our deeds, words, and thoughts in this lifetime\u2014the three categories of action\u2014determines the course or trajectory of our lives throughout the three existences of past, present, and future.\n\nThat is why Nichiren Daishonin teaches that all of our efforts for kosen-rufu\u2014chanting daimoku, talking to others about Buddhism, and taking action for others\u2019 happiness\u2014create good causes and benefit in our lives (cf. WND-1, 4).*1 Consequently, there is no need to worry about how things may appear in the short term.\n\nIf you are ill, think of yourself as engaged in training for climbing the lofty peak of Buddhahood. Think of yourself as surmounting one slope after another, so that eventually you can stand on the summit and endlessly enjoy the wonderful view. Or think of yourself as swimming through rough seas toward a distant, shimmering island of hope and eternal happiness.\n\nLive out your life with the spirit that everything you do is creating a record of brilliant achievement for your own wonderful eternal victory.\n\nWhen you practice Nichiren Buddhism, nothing in your life is ever wasted. Please live without hesitation, fear, or regret. Never forget that everything is a tailwind propelling you forward to eternal happiness.\n\nAll rice shoots ripen within the year they are planted, though some ripen earlier and some later. In the same way, the Daishonin assures us, all people, as long as they persevere seriously in their Buddhist faith and practice, will attain the noble state of Buddhahood within this lifetime (cf. WND-2, 88).*2\n\nFrom a message to an Iwate Prefecture general meeting, September 16, 1996.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1The Daishonin writes: \u201c. . . all your virtuous acts will implant benefits and roots of goodness in your life. With this your conviction you should strive in faith\u201d (WND-1, 4).\n*2The Daishonin writes: \u201cIf votaries of the Lotus Sutra . . . practice as the sutra directs, then every one of them without exception will surely attain Buddhahood within his or her present lifetime. To cite an analogy, if one plants the fields in spring and summer, then, whether it be early or late, one is certain to reap a harvest within the year\u201d (WND-2, 88).\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.8]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.10]"}, {"title": "chapter-4-10.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.10]\n4.10 Cultivating a Lofty Life State Imbued with the Four Virtues\nThose who dedicate their lives to the Mystic Law can attain a completely unshakable life state of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity. To do so, it is crucial to develop a deep faith that cannot be defeated by karma or adversity.\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, Nichiren Daishonin states: \u201cWhen, while in these four states of birth, aging, sickness, and death, we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we cause them to waft forth the fragrance of the four virtues\u201d (OTT, 90).\n\nThe four virtues, or four noble qualities of the Buddha\u2019s life\u2014eternity, happiness, true self, and purity\u2014refer to the supreme state we can attain as human beings, a state of absolute freedom and happiness.\n\n\u201cTrue self\u201d refers to a state of freedom as vast as the universe, in which we can enjoy our true, or greater, self.\n\n\u201cEternity\u201d refers to the dynamism of life that is ceaselessly renewing itself, the creative evolution of life that breaks through all stagnation.\n\n\u201cPurity\u201d refers to the activity of purifying the narrow egoism of our lesser self through the powerful life force of our greater self.\n\nAnd \u201chappiness\u201d refers to the joy of life as it pulses dynamically from moment to moment; it also corresponds to having a fully rounded character that imparts joy to all around us.\n\nIn this way, a person\u2019s character, when illuminated by the Mystic Law, will be firmly grounded in the \u201cgreater self,\u201d a state of boundless freedom that pervades the entire universe, qualitatively transforming even the energy of earthly desires focused on the egotistic \u201clesser self.\u201d In other words, the energy of earthly desires can be elevated and transformed into shining wisdom and compassion; it can be powerfully redirected to a higher level that transcends the individual and benefits others, the community, and society in general.\n\nThis is the Buddhist principle that \u201cearthly desires are enlightenment.\u201d It opens wide a brilliant path by which we can strive for our own perfection along with that of others, while actively working to build an ideal society.\n\nWhat are the ingredients for happiness? This is one of life\u2019s fundamental questions.\n\nThe most crucial determinant for happiness is our own inner state of life.\n\nThose with an expansive inner state of being are happy. They live out their days with an open and confident spirit.\n\nPeople with a strong state of life are happy. They are not defeated by suffering, and can calmly enjoy life as it unfolds.\n\nThose with a profound state of life are happy. Savoring the deep significance of life, they are able to create a record of meaningful and enduring value.\n\nPeople with a pure state of life are happy. They are always spreading refreshing joy to those around them.\n\nThere are countless individuals who are blessed with wealth, social status, and other material advantages, but are unhappy. And such external circumstances are changeable and impermanent; no one knows how long they will last.\n\nBut when you have established an unshakable inner state of happiness, no one can destroy it. Nothing can violate it. Creating this great life state is the aim of your Buddhist practice. The important thing is to never stray from the Gohonzon, to never stop advancing in faith.\n\nIn the course of life, you are bound to face all kinds of difficulties. At times, you may become stuck. That is when you need to strengthen your faith and chant daimoku in earnest. Difficult as it might be, once you surmount the steep mountain of your karma, a new horizon will open wide before you. Buddhist practice is the repetition of this process. Eventually, you will reach a state of absolute happiness that will never be destroyed.\n\nDevelop deep, strongly rooted faith. As long as a sapling has strong roots, and receives enough sunshine and water, it will grow into a tall, sturdy tree, even if it is buffeted by the elements. The same is true of our Buddhist practice and our lives. I hope that all of you will be courageous individuals who cheerfully spread the great light of happiness throughout this troubled world, your lives serving as personal proof of the true greatness of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nFrom a speech at an SGI-Europe general meeting, UK, May 28, 1989.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.9]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.1]"}, {"title": "chapter-5-1.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.1]\n5.1 We Are the Protagonists of Our Own Lives\nFaith in the Mystic Law ensures that by overcoming great pain and suffering we can build a life state of happiness and vibrant joy. President Ikeda has consistently stressed this life of unfettered, limitless hope.\n\nIn this chapter, we will explore the key to overcoming all life\u2019s difficulties and to leading lives of victory.\nWe are each the scriptwriter of our own triumphant drama. We are also its protagonist. Shakespeare wrote: \u201cAll the world\u2019s a stage, / And all the men and women merely players.\u201d*1\n\nBuddhism teaches us that we each write and perform the script of our own life. No one else writes that script for us. We write it, and we are the star who performs it. This extremely active life philosophy is inherent in the teaching of \u201cthree thousand realms in a single moment of life.\u201d*2\n\nWe are each the author and the main character of our own story. In order for it to be a wonderful production, it\u2019s essential that we become so familiar with the scenario that we can picture it vividly. We may need to rehearse it mentally. Sometimes it helps to write down our goals (for example, to pass an examination or to improve at work), and read them over and over again until they are deeply impressed in our minds.\n\nThere once was a young boy who had an accident that left one of his legs shorter than the other. His parents, however, never told him that anything was too hard or impossible for him to do. They treated him like any other child and encouraged him to play sports. They taught him that he could do whatever he believed he could, and that if he was unable to do something, it was because he had decided he couldn\u2019t before even trying. Their conviction wasn\u2019t based on mere idealism or optimism. It was a belief in the latent potential of the human being.\n\nThe boy later became a star football player at school, and after graduation he succeeded in society as well. His life perfectly illustrates the following assertion, made by the Russian writer Maksim Gorky in one of his novels: \u201cTalent is nothing but faith in yourself, in your own powers.\u201d*3\n\nSir Walter Scott, the great Scottish author, wrote: \u201cTo the timid and hesitating everything is impossible, because it seems so.\u201d*4\n\nThinking \u201cIt\u2019s impossible\u201d or \u201cIt can\u2019t be done\u201d has the effect of actually making anything and everything impossible. Similarly, if parents constantly tell their children they are hopeless or inept, the children will come to believe it and may wind up fulfilling that expectation.\n\nNichiren Daishonin cites a passage from the Flower Garland Sutra:\n\n\u201cThe mind is like a skilled painter, who creates various forms made up of the five components.*5 Thus of all the phenomena throughout the entire world, there is not a single one that is not created by the mind. . . . Outside of this mind there is no other phenomenon that exists.\u201d (WND-2, 844)\n\nWhen we read the Daishonin\u2019s letters, we find that he constantly cites sutras and Buddhist scriptures to offer examples and documentary proof relevant to the situations or questions of the recipients, seeking to change their hearts, strengthen their determination, and give them conviction and self-confidence. His words always radiate hope and encouragement, like the sun. This is because he fully understood that when a person\u2019s heart changes, everything changes.\n\nMany people ascribe others\u2019 success to favorable circumstances. They are likely to think, \u201cIf only I had such good luck\u201d or \u201cIf only I didn\u2019t have this problem to deal with.\u201d But that ultimately is just complaining. There is no one who doesn\u2019t have problems.\n\nA businessman once said to a friend: \u201cYou\u2019re always complaining about having so many problems. I know a place where there are at least ten thousand people, and not one of them has even a single problem or worry. Would you like me to take you there?\u201d\n\nHis friend said: \u201cYes, please do!\u201d\n\nAnd guess where the businessman took him? To a cemetery. He was teaching his friend that as long as we are alive, we will have to deal with problems and sufferings. Challenging ourselves to find ways to overcome these problems gives richness and meaning to our lives.\n\nBuddhism teaches that \u201cearthly desires lead to enlightenment.\u201d This means the greater our worries and sufferings, the greater the happiness we can transform them into through the power of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.\n\nIn Shakyamuni\u2019s day, there was a woman who had lost her beloved child to illness. Half insane with grief, she wandered the town clutching her dead child to her bosom and begged all those she encountered: \u201cPlease give me medicine for my child.\u201d\n\nFeeling pity for her, someone took her to see Shakyamuni. When he heard her story, he said: \u201cDo not fret. I will give you good medicine. Go into the town and bring me back some mustard seeds. However, they must be mustard seeds from a family where no one has lost a loved one.\u201d\n\nIn her quest, the woman walked all over the town, going from door to door. But there was not one family that had not lost a loved one. Finally, it dawned on her: All human beings die. She was not alone in her suffering. To gain insight into the eternity of life, she became a follower of Shakyamuni, and she later came to be respected as a sage.*6\n\nBy employing the expedient means of sending her out in search of mustard seeds, Shakyamuni freed and restored peace to the heart of this woman who had been wrapped up in her own grief. He helped her awaken to a deeper wisdom based on the eternity of life.\n\nThe most important thing is to expand our state of life. When we think only of ourselves, we become increasingly caught up in our small egos, or lesser selves. In contrast, when we work toward a great and all-encompassing objective\u2014for the sake of the Law, the happiness of others, and the welfare of society\u2014we can develop big hearts and bring forth our greater selves through the \u201cwonderful workings of one mind\u201d (OTT, 30). With big hearts, we can savor truly immense happiness. Sufferings that may have once been a heavy burden in a lesser state of life will appear minor, and we are able to calmly rise above them. I hope all of you will lead lives in which you can demonstrate such brilliant, positive proof of the \u201cwonderful workings of one mind.\u201d\n\nFrom a speech at an SGI-USA representatives conference, U.S.A., March 9, 1993.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1William Shakespeare, As You Like It, in The Complete Works, Illustrated (New York: Gramercy Books, 1975), p. 239.

The \u201cthree thousand realms\u201d indicates the varying aspects that life assumes at each moment. At each moment, life manifests one of the Ten Worlds. Each of these worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself, thus making one hundred possible worlds. Each of these hundred worlds possesses the ten factors and operates within each of the three realms of existence, thus making three thousand realms. In other words, all phenomena are contained within a single moment of life, and a single moment of life permeates the three thousand realms of existence, or the entire phenomenal world.\n*3Maxim Gorky, The Lower Depths: Unabridged, translated by Jennie Covan and edited by Julie Nord (Toronto: Dover Publications, Inc., 2000), p. 5.\n*4Sir Walter Scott, Rob Roy, edited by Ian Duncan (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 211.\n*5Five components: Also, five components of life.

Together they also constitute one of the three realms of existence, the other two being the realm of living beings and the realm of the environment.\n*6This famous parable about a woman named Kisa Gotami appears in the Therigatha Atthakatha (Commentary to the Therigatha).\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 4:\n\u201cIt Is the Heart That Is Important\u201d [4.10]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.2]"}, {"title": "chapter-5-2.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.2]\n5.2 \u201cEarthly Desires Lead to Enlightenment\u201d\nAs the principle \u201cearthly desires lead to enlightenment\u201d from The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings indicates, Buddhism enables us to transform all our problems and difficulties into the energy to advance.\nBuddhism teaches the principle that \u201cearthly desires lead to enlightenment.\u201d To explain this very simply, \u201cearthly desires\u201d refers to suffering and the desires and cravings that cause suffering, while \u201cenlightenment\u201d refers to happiness and an enlightened state of life.\n\nNormally, one would assume that earthly desires and enlightenment are separate and independent conditions\u2014especially since suffering would seem to be the exact opposite of happiness. But this is not the case in Nichiren Buddhism, which teaches that only by burning the \u201cfirewood\u201d of problems and suffering can we obtain the \u201cflames\u201d of happiness. In other words, by using suffering as fuel, we gain the \u201clight\u201d and \u201cenergy\u201d for happiness. And it is by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo that we \u201cburn the firewood of earthly desires.\u201d\n\nWhen we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, our problems and sufferings all turn into energy for our happiness, into fuel that enables us to keep moving forward in our lives.\n\nThe wonderful thing about faith in Nichiren Buddhism is that it enables those who suffer the most to attain the greatest happiness and those who experience the most daunting problems to lead the most wonderful, meaningful lives.\n\nProblems come in all shapes and sizes. You may be dealing with some personal problem, you may be wondering how to help your parents live long and fulfilling lives, or you may be worried about friends who are sick or depressed and wish for their recovery. On a different level, you may be deeply concerned about the issue of world peace or the direction of the world in the 21st century. These are very noble concerns.\n\nThrough chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, you can turn all these worries and concerns into fuel to propel yourselves forward\u2014you can transform them into life force, into greater depth of character, and into good fortune. I therefore hope you will challenge all kinds of problems, chant abundantly about them, and develop yourselves along the way.\n\nFaith means setting goals and striving to achieve each one. If we view each goal or challenge as a mountain, faith is a process whereby we grow with every mountain climbed.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth, published in Japanese in March 1999.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.1]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.3]"}, {"title": "chapter-5-3.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.3]\n5.3 \u201cChanging Poison into Medicine\u201d\nAccording to the Buddhist principle \u201cchanging poison into medicine,\u201d with strong faith, we can transform the poison of problems and difficulties into the medicine of happiness and victory.\nLife inevitably involves victory and defeat. There may be times of sorrow and suffering. But Buddhism teaches that \u201cearthly desires lead to enlightenment\u201d and \u201cthe sufferings of life and death lead to nirvana.\u201d The greater our problems and suffering, the greater the joy and happiness we can transform them into through our Buddhist practice.\n\nWe practice this Buddhism for our own sake. The purpose of our faith and practice is to live true to ourselves. It is to increase our good fortune and open the way to happiness. Since this is the case, if we are easily swayed by trifling matters, upbeat one minute and down the next, we cannot say that we are truly practicing Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nIn the realm of the Mystic Law, no matter what happens, we can, in time, positively transform all poison into medicine.\n\nIn fact, there is really no clear-cut dividing line between poison and medicine. The same substance can act as either a poison or a medicine, depending on the dosage and the life force of the individual who takes it. Some have even described medicine as \u201cpoison that saves lives.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, there is no clear difference between what will function as poison or medicine when it comes to victory and defeat in life. For instance, if we triumph in the end, everything we experienced can be seen as medicine. On the other hand, if our lives end in defeat, then everything\u2014even that which seemed to function as medicine along the way\u2014becomes poison.\n\nWhat do we mean by triumphing in the end? It means being victorious in faith. For this is our true victory as a human being\u2014one that leads to our victory throughout the three existences of past, present, and future.\n\nFrom a speech at a chapter leaders meeting, Tokyo, July 27, 1989.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.2]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.4]"}, {"title": "chapter-5-4.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.4]\n5.4 Creating the Future with the Buddhism of True Cause\nBuddhism teaches the principle of cause and effect in our lives\u2014that our present situation is the effect caused by our past actions. Nichiren Buddhism, however, teaches the \u201ctrue cause\u201d\u2014that we are not bound by our past but are always embarking from the present moment into the future.\nIt often seems that people only begin to seriously consider the nature of cause and effect or what it means to lead a happy life when they experience acute suffering themselves. When all is going smoothly, they tend not to give much thought to the truly important things in life. In that sense, difficulties play a crucial role in helping us lead deeper and more meaningful lives. In fact, that\u2019s how we should look at them.\n\nNo life is utterly without problems or difficulties. All too often, seemingly happy life circumstances can become a cause of suffering and unhappiness. This is something we come to recognize more and more as we mature in years and experience.\n\nA married couple\u2019s happiness, for instance, may be shattered when their child is born with a serious illness. All sorts of unanticipated events can assail us\u2014a sudden economic downturn, a fire or accident, family discord, divorce, difficult personal relationships. They can even sometimes lead to lifelong suffering. It is truly the case that we never know what tomorrow brings. None can declare with certainty that they will never encounter misfortune.\n\nEven those who enjoy security and tranquillity can come to feel that their lives have no meaning as they age. There are still others who always seem to be busily engaged in purposeful endeavors, but are in reality simply trying to escape loneliness and emptiness by doing so, unwilling to reflect on themselves or their lives.\n\nBehind a smile might lie sadness. After pleasure might come emptiness. Problems and suffering are inescapable realities of life. And yet, we must go on living. How, then, should we live? How can we change suffering into true joy? The Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin has the answer to these important and fundamental questions.\n\nThe Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism is the Buddhism of true cause.*1 It is a great, revolutionary teaching. It reveals that Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the fundamental cause for attaining enlightenment and that, by simply embracing the Gohonzon, we can acquire in this lifetime all the practices and virtues of the Buddha.*2\n\nThe Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism focuses on the present and the future. Its essence is for us to always keep advancing while looking toward and brightly illuminating the future.\n\nPracticing this Buddhism doesn\u2019t mean that problems and suffering disappear. The reality of life is that, within any of the Ten Worlds,*3 the other nine are always present\u2014hence, the nine worlds characterized by delusion and suffering also exist within the world of Buddhahood. Likewise, the world of Buddhahood can only express itself within the reality of the other nine worlds.\n\nThe important thing is to remain undaunted when difficulties arise, to firmly believe that they are expressions of the Buddha\u2019s compassion and forge ahead with even stronger faith.\n\nSome may weakly succumb to doubt and question why they still have problems even though they are practicing the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism. But such a weak way of thinking will\u2014in accord with the principle of \u201cthree thousand realms in a single moment of life\u201d*4\u2014come to permeate every aspect of their lives and create a state of even greater suffering. This is the opposite of having strong faith.\n\nAs ordinary people, we may not be able to fathom why a particular event happens at a particular time, but over the long term we will come to understand its meaning. We will also be able to positively transform the situation, changing poison into medicine. I can say this with complete confidence based on my personal experience of more than four decades of Buddhist practice. We may not understand the significance of a certain event until five or ten years later, or it may even take a lifetime. However, from the perspective of the eternity of life spanning the three existences, everything has meaning as an expression of the Buddha wisdom.\n\nFrom a speech at a nationwide youth division leaders meeting, Tokyo, April 29, 1988.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1True cause: Also, mystic principle of the true cause. Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism directly expounds the true cause for enlightenment as Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, which is the Law of life and the universe. It teaches a way of Buddhist practice of always moving forward from this moment on based on this fundamental Law.\n*2Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cShakyamuni\u2019s practices and the virtues he consequently attained are all contained within the five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo. If we believe in these five characters, we will naturally be granted the same benefits as he was\u201d (WND-1, 365).\n*3Ten Worlds: The realms of hell, hungry spirits, animals, asuras, human beings, heavenly beings, voice-hearers, cause-awakened ones, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas. They are also referred to as the ten life states of hell, hunger, animality, anger, humanity, heaven, learning, realization, bodhisattva, and Buddhahood.\n*4Three thousand realms in a single moment of life: A philosophical system established by the Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai of China based on the Lotus Sutra. The \u201cthree thousand realms\u201d indicates the varying aspects that life assumes at each moment. At each moment, life manifests one of the Ten Worlds. Each of these worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself, thus making one hundred possible worlds. Each of these hundred worlds possesses the ten factors and operates within each of the three realms of existence, thus making three thousand realms. In other words, all phenomena are contained within a single moment of life, and a single moment of life permeates the three thousand realms of existence, or the entire phenomenal world.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.3]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.5]"}, {"title": "chapter-5-5.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.5]\n5.5 Living with Joy throughout All\nIn this selection, President Ikeda emphasizes that living with joy is the hallmark of a genuine practitioner.\nLeo Tolstoy exclaimed: \u201cRejoice! Rejoice! The business of life, its purpose, is joy. Rejoice at the sky, the sun, the stars, the grass, the trees, animals, people.\u201d*1\n\n\u201cRejoice!\u201d\u2014that was one of the ultimate conclusions the great Russian writer and thinker reached in life.\n\nLiving with joy throughout all is the hallmark of a lofty state of being, of strength and happiness. A life that greets everything with criticism and complaint is miserable, in contrast, no matter how fine it might look from the outside.\n\nIn 1901, Tolstoy was excommunicated by the Russian Orthodox Church. He was 72 at the time, already advanced in years. The Church thought that taking this punitive measure would humiliate Tolstoy, who was widely admired around the world. But he was unruffled by the tactics of the Church authorities. He observed their actions with serene dignity.\n\n\u201cRejoice, rejoice!\u201d His conviction remained unshaken. In fact, he burned with a passionate fighting spirit.\n\nTolstoy\u2019s life was not untroubled. He struggled with his writing, with unhappiness in his family life, and with illness. But his spirit always and everywhere sought out and created joy.\n\nThis is also the Buddhist way of life. I hope you will all lead lives of pursuing and creating joy.\n\nNichiren Daishonin declared: \u201cNam-myoho-renge-kyo is the greatest of all joys\u201d (OTT, 212). A life dedicated to kosen-rufu is a life of supreme joy. He also wrote:\n\nI feel immeasurable delight even though I am now an exile. (WND-1, 386)\n\n***\n\nThe more the government authorities rage against me, the greater is my joy. (WND-1, 243)\n\n***\n\nThe greater the hardships befalling [the votary of the Lotus Sutra], the greater the delight he feels, because of his strong faith. (WND-1, 33)\n\nAnd at the time of the Tatsunokuchi Persecution, the Daishonin said to his loyal disciple Shijo Kingo, who accompanied him: \u201cWhat greater joy could there be?\u201d (WND-1, 767). \u201cYou should smile!\u201d he was telling him.\n\nWhen hardships occur, the Daishonin taught, \u201cThe wise will rejoice while the foolish will retreat\u201d (WND-1, 637).\n\nThe more challenges we face, the more joyfully we should move forward and the more determinedly we should tackle them\u2014this is the essence of Nichiren Buddhism and the most valuable way to lead our lives.\n\nA joyless life is miserable. Those who are put off by everything, who are always negative, wear pained expressions, and do nothing but criticize and complain, are not living as the Daishonin teaches in his writings.\n\nThose who can find joy in everything, who can transform everything into joy, are genuine experts in the art of living.\n\nIn \u201cLetter from Sado\u201d the Daishonin writes: \u201cWorthies and sages are tested by abuse\u201d (WND-1, 303). Truly great individuals are distinguished by their ability to endure criticism and abuse and calmly lead joyful lives.\n\nFinding joy in everything\u2014when you brim with joy, you will lift the spirits of those around you, bring smiles to people\u2019s faces, and create value.\n\nIt is vital above all that leaders constantly think about how they can enable everyone to advance with joy.\n\nFrom a speech at a divisional representatives meeting, Tokyo, June 28, 1993.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Leo Tolstoy, Tolstoy\u2019s Diaries, edited and translated by R.

It is from a letter of encouragement the Daishonin sent to Shijo Kingo, who found himself in difficult circumstances. Kingo had incurred his lord\u2019s disfavor by trying to convert him to the Daishonin\u2019s teaching, an act that also invited hostility from his fellow samurai retainers. The Daishonin writes to him:\n\n\u201cSuffer what there is to suffer, enjoy what there is to enjoy. Regard both suffering and joy as facts of life, and continue chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, no matter what happens. How could this be anything other than [experiencing] the boundless joy of the Law? Strengthen your power of faith more than ever.\u201d (WND-1, 681)\n\nRight now, your life may be filled with suffering. But just as pleasure never lasts forever, neither does suffering. In life, there is both suffering and joy. Sometimes we win, and other times we lose. Both suffering and joy are a part of life; this is life\u2019s reality. That is why, whether experiencing suffering or joy, we should keep chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, just as we are, says the Daishonin. If we do that, we will attain a state of supreme happiness through the wisdom and power of the Mystic Law. We can lead a life in which nothing will defeat us.\n\nThe Daishonin uses the phrase \u201cexperiencing the boundless joy of the Law.\u201d \u201cExperiencing\u201d here means that we obtain and savor this joy ourselves. It comes down to us, not others. This joy is not bestowed on us by someone else or something outside us. Creating our own happiness and experiencing that happiness for ourselves; developing the inner strength and capacity to serenely enjoy life, regardless of its ups and downs\u2014this is the meaning of \u201cexperiencing the boundless joy of the Law.\u201d The power of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo enables us to do this.\n\nFor that reason, we don\u2019t need to compare ourselves with others. We should simply live in a way that is true to ourselves, based on faith in the Gohonzon.\n\nPlease advance in good health and with clear goals, while cultivating positive, harmonious relations with those around you. By conducting yourself in this way, you will naturally become the kind of person others admire, are drawn to, and want to get to know. The Mystic Law enables you to utilize your potential to the fullest. When that happens, you can go anywhere and face anything with a sense of confidence and ease. You\u2019ll be able to do what you need to do, unswayed by immediate events and circumstances, and lead a life of deep satisfaction, without regrets. That is the mark of a true victor in life.\n\nFrom a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Tokyo, April 21, 2005.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.5]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.7]"}, {"title": "chapter-5-7.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.7]\n5.7 Difficulties Are a Driving Force for Growth\nThe great life state attained by Nichiren Daishonin, who surmounted a succession of hardships and persecutions, teaches us the importance of turning adversity into the energy to advance.\nNichiren Daishonin\u2019s life was a series of hardships and persecutions, including being exiled twice. Some of his disciples questioned where any peace and comfort was to be found in all this. But the Daishonin insisted that difficulties are in fact peace and comfort and in his writings repeatedly made such statements as: \u201cWhat fortune is mine!\u201d (WND-1, 402); \u201cHow delighted I am!\u201d (WND-1, 402); \u201cIn future lives I will enjoy immense happiness, a thought that gives me great joy\u201d (WND-1, 287); and \u201cHow can such joy possibly be described!\u201d (WND-1, 396). He savored a state of life that he could only describe as \u201cHow fortunate, how joyful!\u201d (WND-1, 642).\n\nIn the light of the Buddhist scriptures, difficulties are inevitable. The important thing is how we transform them, changing poison into medicine, and use them as the driving force for fresh growth and progress.\n\nThere is no point in feeling anxious or lamenting each time the harsh winds of adversity blow. If we have a powerful determination to change everything that happens into a strong \u201ctailwind,\u201d we can surely open the way forward.\n\nWe of the Soka Gakkai have been able to create a history of tremendous development based on faith that is focused on the present and the future\u2014namely, always looking from the present moment onward and moving forward, ever forward.\n\nWithout hardships, there is no true Buddhist practice. Without struggle, there is no genuine happiness. And that would not be real life. There would be no attainment of Buddhahood, either. When we practice the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism with this understanding, we will never reach an impasse.\n\nThe power of one\u2019s state of life is indeed wondrous. The power of one\u2019s inner determination is limitless. In identical situations or circumstances, people can achieve completely different results and lead completely different lives depending upon their life state and their determination.\n\nThose who have a strong resolve to promote our movement for kosen-rufu will see clear blue skies of good fortune appearing rapidly in their lives, stretching ever further and further, as if the wind were sweeping away every dark cloud.\n\nFrom a speech at a Nagano Prefecture general meeting, Nagano, August 4, 1991.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.6]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.8]"}, {"title": "chapter-5-8.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.8]\n5.8 Polishing Ourselves through Adversity\nPresident Ikeda explains the significance of hardships we encounter in spite of practicing Buddhism to attain happiness.\nWhy do we have to endure hardships? The purpose of our Buddhist practice is to attain Buddhahood. Buddhahood is the state of absolute happiness. Though we are practicing Nichiren Buddhism to become happy, why then do we have to overcome obstacles? The reason is that we need to undergo the trials of difficulty to forge and strengthen within us the diamond-like and indestructible \u201cself\u201d of Buddhahood.\n\nThe diamond is regarded as the king of gemstones. It is the hardest of all minerals, possessing unmatched brilliance. A symbol of purity, its name derives from the Greek word adamas meaning \u201cunconquerable\u201d or \u201cinvincible.\u201d\n\nHow are diamonds formed? I\u2019m not a scientist, but it is widely known that diamonds, like graphite, are made of carbon. Deep in the earth, this material is subjected to intense heat and pressure until it is transformed into the crystalline structure of a diamond.\n\nThis is similar to how we develop ourselves. Only when subjected to the concentrated pressure of hardships and the fierce heat of great adversity will the core of our lives, our deepest self, be transformed into the diamond-like and indestructible life state of Buddhahood. In other words, it is through experiencing hardships that we acquire the \u201cdiamond-like body,\u201d or the Buddha body\u2014a brightly shining state of absolute happiness as indestructible as a diamond that cannot be crushed by any amount of suffering or delusion.\n\nA smooth and uneventful kind of Buddhist practice without any difficulties cannot truly help us polish and forge our lives. It is only when we withstand the intense heat and pressure of great hardships that we can shine as \u201cchampions of life,\u201d sparkling like the most perfect of diamonds.\n\nSuch a diamond-like state of life shines with a pure, beautiful, and imperishable light. It is solid and indestructible when buffeted by the turbulent tides of society and the obstacles of corrupt and ill-intentioned forces. We can achieve this state of life through earnestly chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and dedicating ourselves to kosen-rufu. Then our lives will forever be one with the Mystic Law, and we can strive for kosen-rufu with complete freedom throughout eternity. By correctly embracing and upholding the Gohonzon, we can become our greatest possible selves, continuing in this supreme state of Buddhahood in lifetime after lifetime.\n\nPlease lead brilliant lives that are diamond-like and indestructible. Indeed, may you all become \u201cdiamonds\u201d of happiness that sparkle with the radiance of your beautiful hearts. To do so, please never fear hardships. Don\u2019t allow yourselves to be defeated by unfounded criticism. Rather, be grateful for all obstacles, because they help you polish and develop yourselves.\n\nThose who show even stronger conviction in faith and engage even more joyfully in Buddhist practice the greater the hardships they encounter will truly live as diamond-like champions.\n\nPlease magnificently adorn this precious life with beautiful faith and beautiful friendship. Live out your days spreading the sublime diamond-like light of life far and wide and demonstrating the truth of the teachings and principles of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nFrom a speech at a Funabashi leaders meeting, Chiba, July 13, 1987.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.7]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.9]"}, {"title": "chapter-5-9.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.9]\n5.9 Winter Always Turns to Spring\nPresident Ikeda encourages us to look to the future with confidence and determination.\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cWinter always turns to spring\u201d (WND-1, 536). Those who believe in the Lotus Sutra may seem to be in winter, he says, but winter will definitely give way to spring.\n\nThese words of the Daishonin have enabled countless individuals to find their way forward to a springtime of rebirth, a springtime in life. It is one of our eternal guidelines, and its message, without a doubt, will continue to impart boundless hope to billions of people around the world who are searching for true happiness. Let us then consider the infinite compassion of the Daishonin that is embodied in these words.\n\nHe wrote them to encourage the lay nun Myoichi. Her husband had been a person of strong faith. After the Tatsunokuchi Persecution, he was stripped of his estate because of his faith in the Daishonin\u2019s teachings. Those who are in the right are often persecuted\u2014that is the unfortunate way of our corrupt world, a constant we can observe in every country and every age. While the Daishonin was in exile on Sado, Myoichi\u2019s husband died, remaining steadfast in faith to the end of his life. He left behind his wife who was elderly and frail, a son who was ill, and also a daughter.\n\nThe Daishonin was very aware of the lay nun\u2019s situation. In his letter, he imagined how grieved her husband must have been to leave her and their children behind, worried about what would become of them when he was no longer there, and how he would also have been anxious about the fate of the Daishonin (cf. WND-1, 535\u201336).\n\nAs I mentioned, Myoichi\u2019s husband died while the Daishonin was still in exile on Sado, an island of freezing winters from which few exiles returned alive. His heart must have been filled with sorrow and concern for the Daishonin.\n\nThinking of his courageous disciple who had passed away amid severe hardship, the Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cPerhaps your husband felt that certainly something would happen and this priest [Nichiren] would become highly respected. When I was exiled [to Sado] contrary to his expectations, he must have wondered how the Lotus Sutra and the ten demon daughters*1 could possibly have allowed it to happen. Were he still living, how delighted he would be to see Nichiren pardoned!\u201d*2 (WND-1, 536)\n\nAs this passage and other letters indicate, many of the Daishonin\u2019s disciples had expected that he would achieve a position of acclaim and honor. In reality, however, his life was filled with endless persecution. He was defamed and ridiculed throughout the land and subjected to unrelenting harassment. Among his followers were some who had expected their own reputations to rise along with the Daishonin\u2019s, but when their hopes in this regard were dashed they abandoned their Buddhist practice or joined the ranks of the Daishonin\u2019s opponents. They conspired with the authorities and began to maneuver behind the scenes to harm their former teacher and fellow practitioners.\n\nYet even amid all this, Myoichi\u2019s husband remained true and steadfast in his convictions. He must have dreamed of the Daishonin\u2019s triumphant return and been angered and pained at the mean-spirited betrayal by some of his followers.\n\nThe Daishonin knew what was going on in his disciples\u2019 minds. He was fully aware of everything. He refused to compromise in the slightest degree with evil and injustice and confronted persecution head-on.\n\nThat is why the Daishonin writes that Myoichi\u2019s deceased husband would surely have been delighted and overjoyed at the Daishonin\u2019s safe return from Sado\u2014an outcome that no one at the time had expected. This passage powerfully communicates his wish that his faithful follower, who had stood by him through great hardships, could witness his victory and rejoice along with him.\n\nIn the same letter, the Daishonin writes that Myoichi\u2019s late husband would also have been glad to see that the Daishonin\u2019s prediction of a Mongol invasion had come true, affirming the correctness of his assertions. Though foreign invasion, of course, was a tragic event for the country, such a reaction from a disciple was simply a matter of human nature, he points out, \u201cthe feelings of ordinary people\u201d (WND-1, 536).\n\nNo doubt upon reading this, the lay nun Myoichi felt she could hear the Daishonin\u2019s voice saying: \u201cWe are united in our joys and sufferings.\u201d\n\nThe Daishonin\u2019s words \u201cwinter always turns to spring\u201d are written with regard to the circumstances just described. He is telling her, in effect: \u201cYour husband died in \u2018winter.\u2019 But \u2018spring\u2019 has now arrived. Winter always turns to spring. Live out your life to the fullest. Those who remain true to their convictions are sure to attain Buddhahood. You cannot fail to become happy. Your husband is most certainly watching over you and your family.\u201d\n\nIn addition, with deep care and compassion, the Daishonin assures Myoichi that he stands ready to look after her children if the time ever arises (cf. WND-1, 536). Such limitless kindness and warm humanity are the lifeblood of the compassionate Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin. There is not the slightest trace of authoritarianism. How wonderful!\n\nThe words \u201cWinter always turns to spring\u201d can also be read as an expression of the Daishonin\u2019s own conviction and actual proof, having experienced the spring of victory after weathering the bleakest circumstances during his exile on Sado.\n\nThe Daishonin faced persecution after persecution, trials that could not be surmounted without the power of Buddhahood. Ordinarily, someone subject to such ongoing persecution would most likely fall ill, have a nervous breakdown, commit suicide, or end up being killed. The Daishonin, however, triumphed over every adversity. He survived and lived on. For the sake of all humankind, he transmitted the Buddhism of the Three Great Secret Laws for the eternal future of the Latter Day of the Law. We must be deeply aware of his immense compassion in doing so.\n\nThe lay nun Myoichi was no doubt profoundly moved by the Daishonin\u2019s message calling on his followers to observe his victory of \u201cwinter turning into spring\u201d and to adopt it as a model in their own lives.\n\nWe also need to attain our own \u201cspring of happiness\u201d\u2014not only for ourselves but also for the sake of our fellow members who have striven alongside us for many long years. It is important for us to set an example so that those coming after us can look at us, rejoice, and say: \u201cHow wonderful! Those who continue practicing the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism become outstanding people and attain happiness!\u201d\n\nOver the past decade, I have attained a \u201cspring of victory\u201d that no one could have imagined. It is all due to my single-minded commitment to do this for the sake of kosen-rufu and for my fellow members.\n\nSeniors in faith have a responsibility to demonstrate victory, for the sake of their fellow members who have been striving valiantly for kosen-rufu. By victory, of course, I do not mean the external trappings of worldly success or superficial honors. True victory exists in realizing the great uncrowned state of having joyfully and confidently fulfilled one\u2019s mission in life, as a human being and as a practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nSpring is the time when flowers bloom. But in order to bloom, flowers need the cold of winter. What would happen if there was no winter?\n\nIn autumn, plants that bloom in spring prepare to enter a period of dormancy, or recharging. They start saving energy for the coming spring. If there is a sudden warm spell during their dormancy in winter and they are awakened, the buds waiting for spring\u2019s arrival start to open before they are ready, and when the winter cold returns, they wither and die. To prevent that from happening, plants will not bloom unless they have fully experienced the cold of winter. This is the \u201cwisdom\u201d of plants that enables them to bloom in spring.\n\nLife and Buddhist practice also follow this principle. A winter of adversity is the time to recharge our batteries and temper ourselves for the arrival of a wonderful spring. In life\u2019s winters, the eternal and indestructible energy for attaining Buddhahood is stored up, and life force as vast as the universe is forged. This energy, in addition, grows in response to adversity and hardship. And all who practice the correct teaching of Buddhism will without fail experience the coming of spring.\n\nBut if, in the difficult times of life\u2019s winters, we try to avoid or doubt the realm in which we strengthen our faith, and as a result we fail to accumulate enough strength and good fortune, we will never get anywhere, nor be able to lead a truly satisfying life. The crucial thing is how we challenge ourselves and how meaningfully we spend our time during life\u2019s winters. What matters is how deeply we live with the conviction that spring will definitely arrive. In the realm of nature, the flowering springtime always comes when the time is right. That is the rhythm of life and the universe. But far too many people in the world are still in the midst of winter when they reach the end of their lives. To avoid that fate, we need to align our lives with the rhythm of the universe that calls forth spring. And our Buddhist practice based on faith in the Mystic Law is what enables us to do that.\n\nIn that sense, faith in the Mystic Law functions as our wings to eternal happiness. Every time we overcome difficulties, we accumulate good fortune and elevate our state of life. By attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime, we are able to soar serenely through the vast skies of life in a state of supreme happiness and fulfillment throughout eternity. This is the teaching of Buddhism and the rhythm of life.\n\nFrom a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Tokyo, April 29, 1990.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Ten demon daughters: The ten female protective deities who appear in the \u201cDharani\u201d (26th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra as the \u201cdaughters of rakshasa demons\u201d or the \u201cten rakshasa daughters.\u201d They vow to the Buddha to guard and protect the sutra\u2019s votaries.\n*2The Daishonin had been pardoned the previous year, in March 1274, and was residing at Minobu when he wrote this letter, \u201cWinter Always Turns to Spring,\u201d dated May 1275.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.8]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.10]"}, {"title": "chapter-5-10.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.10]\n5.10 The Principle of \u201cLessening Karmic Retribution\u201d\nThe principle of lessening karmic retribution represents a radical rethinking of the concept of karma, enabling us to engage positively with adversity through strong faith.\nNichiren Daishonin offered the following encouragement to the Ikegami brothers, Munenaka and Munenaga, who were in the midst of a struggle against serious obstacles: \u201cThe blessings gained by practicing the correct teaching [the Mystic Law], however, are so great that by meeting minor sufferings in this life we can change the karma that destines us to suffer terribly in the future\u201d (WND-1, 497).\n\nThrough \u201cthe blessings gained by practicing the correct teaching\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cthe blessings obtained by protecting the Law\u201d*1\u2014the grave negative effects of karma that we would otherwise have experienced in the future are transformed and received as minor effects in the present. We need to be deeply convinced of this principle, called \u201clessening karmic retribution.\u201d*2 And, to a degree that accords with the depth of our faith, we can experience its reality in our own lives.\n\nFor instance, suppose you meet with an accident, but it is very minor and not a disaster that involves many people. This could be an instance of receiving the effects of negative karma in a lessened form. You can probably think of many similar examples.\n\nIn this way, we can clearly see the significance of hardships from the perspective of the eternity of life across the three existences of past, present, and future. In other words, by undergoing hardships, we can transform in this lifetime the cycle of negative causes and effects in our lives and magnificently reveal within us the brilliant, vibrant state of Buddhahood.\n\nThe Daishonin discussed these principles of \u201clessening karmic retribution\u201d and \u201cthe blessings obtained by protecting the Law\u201d in terms of his own life in works such as \u201cThe Opening of the Eyes\u201d and \u201cLetter from Sado,\u201d which he composed while in exile on Sado Island. Though the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law, the Daishonin strove as an ordinary person to demonstrate, for the sake of his followers into the eternal future of the Latter Day, the reason why we encounter difficulties. He also taught us the essence of \u201cfaith for overcoming hardships.\u201d This is a crucial guideline both for our personal lives and for the realm of kosen-rufu.\n\nThree years ago [in October 1985], I was hospitalized for the first time in my life, for 10 days. Objectively speaking, I could have collapsed at any moment. After all, I had been working relentlessly for 40 years since joining the Soka Gakkai, and for nearly 30 years since I had inherited the mantle of our organization\u2019s leadership from Mr. Toda. I had been pushing myself to the limit, even though when I was younger the doctors had said I probably wouldn\u2019t live to see the age of 30. I was constantly on the go. I was always fighting against adversity.\n\nThe media made a big fuss about my hospitalization. There were also many unfounded speculations, and some people moved to act against me motivated by self-interest and calculation. But I understood exactly what was going on. Personally, I felt that my illness was a gift arising from the Buddha\u2019s great compassion. I was convinced it was teaching me that the time had come to stand up again on my own and start in earnest on completing my work for kosen-rufu.\n\nNow, I thought, is the time to speak the full truth. Now is the time to offer, from every angle, thoroughgoing guidance for the sake of future generations. I resolved that I must convey the Soka Gakkai\u2019s true greatness and its profound significance and spirit.\n\nUntil then, I thought I had done my utmost to build a solid organization and teach all that had been necessary. But now, with my illness, I pledged to teach 10 or 20 times more and to work 10 or 20 times harder. And I began, and continue, to do so.\n\nWhat I am saying is that you are bound to encounter obstacles and difficulties in life of one degree or another. But please know that they all derive from the Buddha\u2019s compassion, aimed at helping you become strong, like tall, sturdy trees.\n\nWith that conviction, please forge ahead as champions of faith, overcoming all challenges and opening the way forward in your lives and for kosen-rufu with ever greater strength, resilience, and joy with each obstacle you face.\n\nFrom a speech at a nationwide youth division leaders meeting, Tokyo, April 29, 1988.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1\u201cThe blessings obtained by protecting the Law\u201d: This phrase from the Parinirvana Sutra is quoted in \u201cLetter to the Brothers\u201d (WND-1, 497).\n*2Lessening karmic retribution: This term, which literally means, \u201ctransforming the heavy and receiving it lightly,\u201d appears in the Nirvana Sutra. \u201cHeavy\u201d indicates negative karma accumulated over countless lifetimes in the past. As a benefit of protecting the correct teaching of Buddhism, we can experience relatively light karmic retribution in this lifetime, thereby expiating heavy karma that ordinarily would adversely affect us not only in this lifetime, but over many lifetimes to come.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 5:\nTransforming Suffering into Joy [5.9]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.1]"}, {"title": "chapter-6-1.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.1]\n6.1 \u201cStill I Will Bloom\u201d\nBuddhism teaches the principle of cherry, plum, peach, and damson\u2014that every being is beautiful and valuable as it is, without trying to be something else.\n\nEveryone possesses the seed of a precious mission. The purpose of our lives is to make that seed sprout, flourish, and blossom.\n\nOn a visit to Yamagata Prefecture, President Ikeda explains this principle and urges us to dedicate our lives to our mission.\nThis is my first visit to Yamagata in nine years. Wishing to see you all as soon as possible, I took the train here from Niigata. From the train window, I could see blue streams and green forests amid the lingering mountain snow. Golden forsythia, bridal veil, daffodils, and cherry blossoms were in beautiful bloom.\n\nObserving the scenery, I was reminded of how, in The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, Nichiren Daishonin states that the cherry, plum, peach, and damson each embody the ultimate truth just as they are, without undergoing any change (cf. OTT, 200).*1 This teaching provides us with a basic model for the way we should live our lives.\n\nThe cherry tree blossoms as a cherry tree, living to fulfill its own unique role. The same is true of the plum, peach, and damson trees. Each of us should do likewise. We each have a unique personality. We have a distinct nature and character, and our lives are each noble and respectworthy. That\u2019s why we should always live with a solid self-identity, in a way that is true to ourselves.\n\nEach of us has a mission and a way of life that is ours alone. We don\u2019t need to try to be like anyone else. The cherry tree has its own life and inherent causes for being a cherry. The plum, peach, and damson also each have their own inherent causes. And in the same way, from the viewpoint of Buddhism, we each have a mission we were born to carry out in this world, and each one of us has our own inherent causes to be who we are. Practicing the Mystic Law enables us to experience the joy of discovering this.\n\nThe most fundamental happiness in life is to bring forth our inner Buddhahood through the power of faith in the Mystic Law.\n\nSome of you may envy those who live in bustling cities such as Tokyo. Others might wish to have a glamorous job, or live in a big luxurious house. But in Tokyo, you can\u2019t enjoy this natural environment [of Yamagata] with its pure, clean air, the bright moonlight or the twinkling stars at night, or beautiful mountains draped softly in their white mantles, like Mount Zao standing out against the morning sky. At the same time, our happiness in life does not depend on the land or environment in which we live, our workplace, or the size of our homes.\n\nThe grass always seems greener on the other side. To those living in Yamagata, life in the big city might seem appealing, but city dwellers long for the beautiful natural environment of Yamagata. The key is to give full play to our capabilities and carry out our mission in our own communities, wherever we are, without being swayed by immediate circumstances or events.\n\nA writer once remarked: \u201cWhether seen by others or not, still I will bloom.\u201d*2 The Gohonzon is aware of all our actions. It is important to live in our own unique way, always embraced by the Mystic Law, whether or not anyone is watching. This is what the principle of cherry, plum, peach, and damson teaches.\n\nFrom a speech at a Yamagata Prefecture general meeting, Yamagata, April 18, 1983.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1The Daishonin says: \u201cEach thing\u2014the cherry, the plum, the peach, the damson\u2014in its own entity, without undergoing any change, possesses the eternally endowed three bodies [of the Buddha]\u201d (OTT, 200).\n*2Translated from Japanese.

When that underlying nature takes the form of gentleness, it\u2019s a strength; when it takes the form of timidity, it can be a weakness. When that underlying nature consistently acts as a weakness, it can become the cause of unhappiness.\n\n\u201cFor example, people with a fiery temper by nature may often end up arguing with coworkers. This could alienate those around them, making for strained relations. In some cases, their hotheadedness could even lead to them being fired or quitting. And since that is their underlying nature, the same problem is sure to crop up wherever they go.\n\n\u201cOur basic underlying natures don\u2019t change, but through our Buddhist practice, we can redirect our natures in a positive manner. Nichiren Daishonin says: \u2018When one comes to realize and see that each thing\u2014the cherry, the plum, the peach, the damson\u2014in its own entity, without undergoing any change, possesses the eternally endowed three bodies [of the Buddha]\u2019 (OTT, 200).\n\n\u201cBuddhism teaches the way for each of us, just as we are, to attain happiness while bringing out the best of our innate disposition and potential\u2014in the same way that the cherry, plum, peach, and damson each manifest their own unique nature.\n\n\u201cPeople with fiery tempers are often also passionate, with a strong sense of right and wrong. By exerting themselves in Buddhist practice, they will no longer lose their tempers about unimportant things, but become people strongly committed to opposing evil and injustice.\n\n\u201cLikewise, people who tend to be too agreeable or easily manipulated by others are often very kindhearted and able to get along well with others. Through practicing Buddhism, they can bring out this latter strong side of their natures. Positively transforming ourselves in this way is what we call human revolution. The important thing is how to make that transformation happen.\n\n\u201cBasically, the key is to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and continue developing your life. It\u2019s crucial to reflect on yourself and discover your problematic qualities and life tendencies.\n\n\u201cWe all have faults. Perhaps we tend to blame others when something bad happens to us, or we lack perseverance, or are unwilling to listen to the opinions of others. These faults can become negative tendencies obstructing our personal growth and happiness.\n\n\u201cBut unless someone points these negative tendencies out to us, we may not be aware of them. That\u2019s where our seniors in faith and fellow members come in. They can draw our attention to them and support us in the effort to overcome them. We also need to chant earnestly to challenge and transform our negative tendencies.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we can also forge and develop ourselves through Soka Gakkai activities. As Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u2018The flaws in iron come to the surface when it is forged\u2019 (WND-1, 497).\n\n\u201cRefusing to allow our weaknesses to defeat us and triumphing in one activity after another is the way we train and strengthen ourselves; it is the path of human revolution for each of us to win over our negative tendencies. Soka Gakkai activities are the \u2018place of practice\u2019 or \u2018training ground\u2019 where we develop and strengthen our lives. By dedicating ourselves to the mission of kosen-rufu and continuing to strengthen and improve ourselves, we can also transform our karma.\u201d\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 16, \u201cHeart and Soul\u201d chapter.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.1]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.3]"}, {"title": "chapter-6-3.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.3]\n6.3 Live True to Yourself\nIn a speech at a gathering commemorating the anniversary of second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda\u2019s death, President Ikeda introduces President Toda\u2019s guidance and stresses the importance of living true to oneself.\nTo know oneself, to know the nature of human beings, to know the preciousness of life\u2014herein lies the important significance of religion.\n\nPresident Toda remarked:\n\n\u201cWhether one is suffering because of poverty, a business failure, a bitter quarrel with one\u2019s spouse, an injury caused by tripping over a hibachi [a charcoal brazier]\u2014ultimately, all these things are a reflection of one\u2019s life. That is, they are outward expressions of one\u2019s inner state of being. When viewed in this way, everything in our lives occurs as a result of the changes unfolding within us. That\u2019s why it is important for us to strive to change for the better and ceaselessly create our own happiness.\n\n\u201cYou therefore have to be true to yourself and take responsibility for your own life. Indeed, it\u2019s vital to recognize that you have no choice but to do so. It\u2019s a mistake to blame others or things outside you for your circumstances, to constantly think: \u2018If only he or she would do this or that\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019d be happy if only the situation in society were such and such.\u2019\n\n\u201cHowever, human beings are weak. They are easily controlled by others or their external circumstances, no matter how they may resolve to be true to themselves, to follow their own convictions. . . .\n\n\u201cThis is why I believe the only way to make one\u2019s life shine with supreme strength, brilliance, and happiness is to base one\u2019s life on Buddhism, which teaches the principles of \u2018three thousand realms in a single moment of life\u2019*1 and the \u2018mutual possession of the Ten Worlds.\u2019\u201d*2 *3\n\nPeople who have vibrant life force are happy. People with strong conviction are happy. They can lead positive, successful lives. Those who are weak, in contrast, are miserable. They create misery and unhappiness for themselves. Practicing Nichiren Buddhism enables us to become as strong as we possibly can. To live in such a way that we can perceive everything in terms of faith and are always determined to overcome everything through faith means to walk the path to eternal happiness.\n\nYou yourself are precious beyond measure\u2014each and every one of you. The Daishonin taught this to his disciples while he himself was facing major persecution. And the Soka Gakkai\u2019s first and second presidents, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Josei Toda, faithfully embraced the heart of the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism and taught it to people from all walks of life.\n\nWith great conviction, let us continue to forge ahead powerfully along this path, which is directly connected to Nichiren Daishonin.\n\nPresident Toda once gave the following guidance to members of the youth division:\n\n\u201cTo believe in your own mind is especially important when you are young. Yet it is difficult to trust one\u2019s mind. This is particularly true during one\u2019s youth, a time of emotional turmoil and confusion. . . .\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the American cartoon \u2018Popeye.\u2019 The main character, Popeye, is so weak that he is constantly being beaten up by others. But when he eats spinach, he instantly acquires strength and easily triumphs over his adversaries. This is because he believes in the power of spinach. . . .\n\n\u201cWe all need to have something we believe in. \u2018I have the Gohonzon. Therefore, I will be able to overcome any problem. Everything will be fine.\u2019\u2014 If you have such firm conviction, you can do anything. . . .\n\n\u201cIf you feel that this is the path in life for you, that it\u2019s the right way to go, then believe in the Gohonzon and make it the core of your convictions. You will definitely be able to overcome any obstacle, including illness and poverty. But it requires the essential ingredient of faith. . . .\n\n\u201cFor youth, the stronger your faith, the more invincible you will be in any situation. Young people need to have something to believe in. You must trust your own hearts.\n\n\u201cYet, because the human heart can be such an unreliable thing, it is important that you make the Gohonzon the foundation of your faith. If you do so, I am sure you will be able to lead your lives with confidence and ease. Please lead your lives that way and help others do the same.\u201d*4\n\nMr. Toda dearly loved young people and held the highest hopes for them. Nothing gave him greater pleasure than seeing the energetic endeavors of the youth division members who brimmed with powerful conviction in faith.\n\nFrom a speech at a representatives gathering commemorating April 2, the anniversary of second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda\u2019s death, Tokyo, April 3, 1993.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Three thousand realms in a single moment of life: A philosophical system established by the Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai of China based on the Lotus Sutra. The \u201cthree thousand realms\u201d indicates the varying aspects that life assumes at each moment. At each moment, life manifests one of the Ten Worlds. Each of these worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself, thus making one hundred possible worlds. Each of these hundred worlds possesses the ten factors and operates within each of the three realms of existence, thus making three thousand realms. In other words, all phenomena are contained within a single moment of life, and a single moment of life permeates the three thousand realms of existence, or the entire phenomenal world.\n*2Mutual possession of the Ten Worlds: The principle that each of the Ten Worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself. \u201cMutual possession\u201d means that life is not fixed in one or another of the Ten Worlds, but can manifest any of the ten\u2014from hell to Buddhahood\u2014at any given moment. The important point of this principle is that all beings in any of the nine worlds possess the Buddha nature. This means that every person has the potential to manifest Buddhahood, while a Buddha also possesses the nine worlds and in this sense is not separate or different from ordinary people.\n*3Translated from Japanese.

In fact, it is quite normal not to have much confidence. In many cases, people who go around bragging about their confidence are merely arrogant, always clashing with and greatly disliked by those around them. A person can be miserable with either too much or too little self-confidence.\n\nThe important thing is that all of you shine in your own way, win in your own daily endeavors, and develop your life in the way most suitable and natural for you. All you need to do is just keep on improving yourself as you steadily advance toward your goal.\n\nAfter all, you are you, not someone else. There is no need for you to compare yourself with others; it\u2019s your life. The important question is, What do you really feel and think in the depths of your being? Buddhism expounds the principle of cherry, plum, peach, and damson, each having their own unique characteristics, and the related principle of \u201cilluminating and manifesting one\u2019s true nature\u201d (cf. WND-1, 746).\n\nCherry blossoms are cherry blossoms, and peach blossoms are peach blossoms. A cherry blossom can never become a peach blossom. Nor is there any need for it to try to do so. It would be perfectly miserable if it did. Similarly, you are none other than yourself. You can never be someone else, however much you might wish it. What matters is that you become the kind of person who can cherish, praise, and feel content with your own precious, irreplaceable life.\n\nChanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is fundamental to this, enabling you to reveal your innate Buddhahood just as you are. Not only will chanting give you a wonderful, fundamental self-confidence, it will also adorn and dignify your life with the brilliance of your true and highest potential.\n\nPlease have absolute confidence in yourself, because you are living the noblest possible life, with a beautiful heart.\n\nFrom a question-and-answer session with SGI-USA Culture Department representatives, Nagano, August 7, 1992.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.3]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.5]"}, {"title": "chapter-6-5.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.5]\n6.5 Developing Your Own Individuality\nIn Dialogue of Hope, addressed to junior high school students, President Ikeda talks about individuality and being oneself.\nSeeking to show their individuality or stand out from the crowd, some young people rush to adopt the latest fashions. But often, all they end up doing is looking just like everyone else. What sense is there in that?\n\nQuite frankly, it almost seems as if there is some kind of set image of what individualism is, with everyone trying to conform to that image. But that image, in most cases, is just something created by the mass media and people trying to turn a profit, a fashion or trend that has been deliberately manufactured.\n\nThat\u2019s why being truly individualistic is actually quite difficult. First, you need to have a solid sense of who you are. You have to open your own eyes and look at the world, open your ears and listen to what others are saying, use your brain and think for yourself, and have the courage to follow through with your convictions.\n\nIt\u2019s much easier to just conform and be like everyone else. Even when people try to free themselves from the constraints that are holding them back, they often find themselves adopting someone else\u2019s standards. Japanese people have a strong tendency for this kind of mass conformity.\n\nGenuine individuality isn\u2019t just a matter of style or outward appearance; it emanates from the inside out.\n\nSomeone has said that your individuality is a singular treasure that only you possess. It may be difficult for you to know exactly what that treasure is right now, but you definitely possess such a treasure, which you share with no one else. Each and every one of you does, with absolutely no exception!\n\nIf there are those who claim they don\u2019t possess this treasure, then it is because they themselves have decided they are worthless. Such thinking causes one to destroy one\u2019s own precious treasure.\n\nOf course, even when trying to \u201cbe themselves,\u201d there are many people who don\u2019t know what that means. That\u2019s quite natural. In fact, all too often what people think of as being true to themselves or exercising their individuality is something they have borrowed or copied from others. That\u2019s why, if you think who you are right now is all there is to you, you are very much mistaken. Human beings have the capacity to change. Who you are now is really no more than the starting point for an even more wonderful you in the future.\n\nTelling yourself, for instance, \u201cI\u2019m a poor speaker, so I\u2019ll stay in the background,\u201d is not living true to yourself. Instead, suppose you earnestly challenge yourself with the spirit to become a person who, though maybe not naturally a good talker, can bravely speak out and stop someone from bullying another, or can speak up for what\u2019s right at a crucial moment. Then, by making that kind of effort, your own unique character will shine in a way that is different from those who are naturally good speakers. That will be your individuality.\n\nYour individuality only really starts to shine when you strive with all your might, challenging yourself with every last ounce of your energy. It won\u2019t if you don\u2019t develop yourself. Only through making efforts to improve and grow will your individuality shine\u2014just as a sword is forged in the flames. Your individuality is your own unique weapon for making the most of your life. It is your jeweled sword.\n\nPeople who have splendidly developed their individuality are beautiful. Everyone finds them attractive. Theirs is not a fleeting, temporary beauty, but an enduring, lifelong one. Such people\u2019s spirit is as bright and clear as the skies over the high plains in summer. They are never envious or jealous of others.\n\nIn Japan, there is a tendency to try to drag down people who have real individuality and character. There is a narrow-minded mentality that seeks conformism, as exemplified by the Japanese proverb, \u201cThe nail that sticks out gets hammered down.\u201d This is inspired by the jealousy and resentment of people who have no solid sense of identity or self-confidence and are always concerned about what others are doing, thinking, or saying, allowing themselves to be swayed this way and that.\n\nIn contrast, people who have worked hard and long to develop their own identities take delight in seeing others develop theirs to the fullest, too. They support and encourage them in their efforts. They take joy in others\u2019 successes. And they have the capacity to work for the happiness and welfare of others.\n\nI hope all of you will become such bighearted, truly beautiful people. Become people whom others admire and respect.\n\nFrom Dialogue of Hope, published in Japanese in June 2003.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.4]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.6]"}, {"title": "chapter-6-6.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.6]\n6.6 Be a Shining Presence like the Sun\nIn Discussions on Youth, President Ikeda talks with high school students and other young people about the keys to finding their unique mission and becoming a shining presence.\nWhen you live in a way that is true to yourself, your real value as a human being shines through. Buddhism teaches the concept of \u201cilluminating and manifesting one\u2019s true nature\u201d (cf. WND-1, 746). This means to reveal your genuine innate self, your true inherent potential, and bring it to shine, illuminating all around you. It refers to your most refined individuality and uniqueness.\n\nThe important thing is to be patient, to have the confidence and determination that you will achieve something meaningful in the future. Don\u2019t be impatient in your youth. Your true substance as human beings will be determined 10, 20, or 30 years from now. What matters is the kind of people you become then and whether you are fulfilling your mission then. Each of you has a mission that only you can fulfill. If you did not have such a mission, you would not have been born.\n\nThere are many kinds of mountains in this world. Some are high and some are low. And there are a great many different kinds of rivers. Some long, some short. Despite their differences, however, all mountains are mountains and all rivers are rivers.\n\nThere are serene mountains like the ones in the ancient Japanese capital of Nara, and there are rugged mountains like Kyushu\u2019s Mount Aso [Japan\u2019s largest active volcano]. Then there are the grand snowcapped peaks of the Himalayas. All of these mountains are beautiful and impressive in their own way.\n\nThe same is so with rivers. There is Hokkaido\u2019s Ishikari River, home to magnificent salmon, as well as Nagano\u2019s Chikuma River, which has inspired countless poets. There is the Yellow River in China, and the Amazon in South America, rivers so wide that in some places the opposite shore cannot be seen. Each of these rivers has its own special beauty.\n\nThe same is true of people. Each of you has a unique mission in life. Moreover, you have encountered the Mystic Law while still young. You have a mission that is yours and yours alone. That is an indisputable fact, one in which I would like you to have conviction and pride.\n\nYou won\u2019t find your mission by standing still. Please challenge yourselves in something, it doesn\u2019t matter what. Then, by your making consistent efforts, the direction you should take will open up before you quite naturally. It\u2019s important, therefore, to have the courage to ask yourselves what you should be doing now, at this very moment.\n\nThe key, in other words, is to climb the mountain before you. As you ascend its slopes, you will develop your \u201cmuscles,\u201d increasing your strength and endurance. Such training will enable you to challenge still higher mountains. It is vital that you continue making such efforts. Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo will enable you to bring forth the life force necessary to succeed.\n\nChant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and climb the mountain in front of you. When you reach the summit, wide new horizons will stretch out before you. Little by little, you will understand your own mission.\n\nThose who never forget that they have a unique mission are strong. Whatever problems they have, they will not be defeated. They will transform all their problems into fuel for growth toward a hope-filled future.\n\nThe important thing, therefore, is to resolve to be a shining presence like the sun. If you do so, all darkness will be dispelled. Live confidently, determined to be the sun in your environment, no matter what happens.\n\nOf course, in life, there are both sunny days and cloudy ones. But even on cloudy days, the sun still shines. The same is true for people. Even when we are struggling, we mustn\u2019t let the light go out in our hearts.\n\n*****\n\nAll people have a unique mission that only they can fulfill. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should simply wait for someone to tell you what yours is. It is important that you discover your mission on your own.\n\nPrecious gems start out buried underground. If no one mines them, they\u2019ll stay buried. And if they aren\u2019t polished once they\u2019ve been dug out, they will remain rough and dull.\n\nAll of you, my young friends, possess a jewel. You are each like a mountain with a hidden treasure. What a shame it would be to spend your entire life without uncovering it!\n\nIt is often said that everyone is a genius at something. Being talented doesn\u2019t just mean being a good musician, writer, or athlete\u2014there are many kinds of talent. For instance, you may be a great conversationalist or make friends easily or put others at ease. Or you may have a gift for nursing, a knack for telling jokes, selling things, or economizing. You may be someone who is always punctual, patient, steady, kind, or optimistic. Or you may love new challenges, be strongly committed to peace, or bring joy to others.\n\nEach of you is as unique as a cherry, plum, peach, or damson blossom (cf. OTT, 200), as Nichiren Daishonin explains. Please bloom in the way that only you can.\n\nWithout a doubt, you each possess within you a jewel, your own innate talent. How can you discover that talent? The only way is to challenge yourself to the limit. Your true potential will emerge when you give everything you\u2019ve got to your studies, sports, or whatever you take on.\n\nThe most important thing is getting into the habit of challenging yourself to the limit in this way. In a sense, the results you get don\u2019t matter all that much. The actual grades you receive in high school, for instance, won\u2019t decide the rest of your life. But the habit of challenging yourself to the limit will in time bear fruit. It will distinguish you from others without fail and bring your unique talents to shine.\n\nIt has been said that we can only become as big as our dreams. That is why you should have big dreams. But it\u2019s important to remember that dreams are dreams and reality is reality. If you want to realize your dreams, you have to take a hard look at reality and then make all-out efforts toward your goals.\n\nMr. Toda once said: \u201cYoung people must have the determination to excel at something.\u201d Determination, tenacity of purpose, is crucial. Halfhearted effort will not make the precious jewel of your unique talents shine.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth, published in Japanese in March 1999.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.5]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.7]"}, {"title": "chapter-6-7.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.7]\n6.7 Advancing Freely and Steadily\nPresident Ikeda prefaced a question-and-answer session with Bharat [India] Soka Gakkai members by stating that \u201copen discussion in which participants can speak freely and ask anything on their minds is a Buddhist tradition dating back to the times of Shakyamuni.\u201d In this excerpt, he offers encouragement to a men\u2019s division member who said he found it difficult to master the qualities of eloquence, wisdom, and compassion that the guidance of the Soka Gakkai suggests we aspire to.\nJust be yourself. All you have to do is keep chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and advance freely in a manner that is true to yourself. That is what the Buddhist principle of \u201cilluminating and manifesting one\u2019s true nature\u201d (cf. WND-1, 746) is all about. By practicing Nichiren Buddhism, we can bring our true self to shine. If this were not the case, we\u2019d be frauds. Naturally, we should exert ourselves in our human revolution, but there is absolutely no need to resort to false or contrived eloquence, compassion, or wisdom.\n\nWhat\u2019s important is to continue making effort daily, chanting and praying for the happiness of others, doing your best to be kind and considerate to those around you, and polishing your own character. But, as Mr. Toda often pointed out, if you can\u2019t treasure your spouse or those closest to you, you won\u2019t be able to treasure others. Compassion, he said, doesn\u2019t flow forth so easily.\n\nSurely the correct path and most dignified way to live is to advance just as we are, as ordinary people, striving to improve ourselves even just by small increments based on chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. Nichiren Buddhism is a great teaching that is open to all people; it does not make irrational or unreasonable demands.\n\nFrom a question-and-answer session on the occasion of a Bharat [India] Soka Gakkai gongyo meeting, India, February 16, 1992.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.6]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.8]"}, {"title": "chapter-6-8.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.8]\n6.8 Everyone Has a Noble Mission\nWhen we base our lives on the principles of Nichiren Buddhism, we can create a diverse and harmonious world where individuality is affirmed and differences respected.\nSpring is near. The plum trees have bloomed, the peach trees have flowered, and soon it will be time for the cherry trees to blossom. The English Romantic poet Shelley said: \u201cIf Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?\u201d*1 No matter how long and bitter the winter may be, spring always follows. This is the law of the universe, the law of life.\n\nThe same applies to us. If we seem to be weathering an endless winter in our lives, we must not abandon hope. As long as we have hope, spring will come without fail. Spring is a time of blossoming.\n\nBuddhism, as I have mentioned many times, teaches the principle of cherry, plum, peach, and damson (cf. OTT, 200). The cherry has its distinct beauty, the plum its delicate fragrance. The peach blossom has its lovely color, and the damson has its delightful charm. Every person has a singular mission, unique individuality, and way of living. It\u2019s important to recognize that truth and respect it. That is the natural order of things. That is how it works in the world of flowers. There, myriad flowers bloom harmoniously in beautiful profusion.\n\nUnfortunately, in our human world, things do not always work this way. Some find it impossible to respect those who are different, so they discriminate against them or harass and torment them. They violate their rights as individuals. This is the source of much suffering and unhappiness in the world.\n\nAll people have a right to flower, to reveal their full potential as human beings, to fulfill their mission in this world. You have this right, and so does everyone else. That is the meaning of human rights. To scorn and violate people\u2019s human rights destroys the natural order of things. We must develop ourselves to become people who prize human rights and respect others.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth, published in Japanese in March 1999.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Percy Bysshe Shelley, \u201cOde to the West Wind,\u201d Shelley\u2014Selected Poetry, selected by Isabel Quigly (London: Penguin Books, 1956), p. 162.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.7]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.9]"}, {"title": "chapter-6-9.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.9]\n6.9 Building a Harmonious World of Brilliant Diversity\nIn a lecture at the East-West Center in Hawaii, President Ikeda discusses the principle of cherry, plum, peach, and damson and Buddhism\u2019s respect for diversity and affirmation of the worth of all people.\nIn the teachings of Nichiren, we find the passage: \u201cThe cherry, the plum, the peach, the damson . . . without undergoing any change . . .\u201d (OTT, 200). These words confirm that there is no need for all to become \u201ccherries\u201d or \u201cplums,\u201d but that each should manifest the unique brilliance of his or her own character.\n\nThis simile points to a fundamental principle of appreciation for diversity that applies equally to human beings and to social and natural environments. As the concept of \u201cilluminating and manifesting one\u2019s true nature\u201d (cf. WND-1, 746) indicates, the prime mission of Buddhism is to enable each and all to blossom to the fullest of their potential. The fulfillment of the individual, however, cannot be realized in conflict with, or at the expense of, others, but only through active appreciation of uniqueness and difference, for these are the varied hues that together weave the flower gardens of life.\n\nNichiren\u2019s teachings also contain the following parable: When you face a mirror and bow respectfully, the image in the mirror likewise bows to you respectfully (cf. OTT, 165).\n\nI think this beautifully expresses the all-encompassing causality that is the heart of Buddhism. The respect we demonstrate for the lives of others returns to us, with mirror-like certainty, ennobling our lives.\n\nThe Buddhist principle of dependent origination reflects a cosmology in which all human and natural phenomena come into existence within a matrix of interrelatedness. Thus, we are urged to respect the uniqueness of each existence, which supports and nourishes all within the larger, living whole.\n\nFrom a lecture at the East-West Center, \u201cPeace and Human Security: A Buddhist Perspective for the Twenty-First Century,\u201d U.S.A., January 26, 1995.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.8]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.10]"}, {"title": "chapter-6-10.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.10]\n6.10 The Wisdom for Fostering the Positive Potential in All People\nIn a peace proposal commemorating the 23rd SGI Day in 1998, President Ikeda discusses the Buddhist principle of cherry, plum, peach, and damson as a source for creating new value, transcending all differences to build a world of harmony and peaceful coexistence.\nEducation does not mean coercing people to fit one rigid and unvaried mold; this is mere ideological indoctrination. Rather, it represents the most effective means of fostering the positive potential inherent in all people\u2014self-restraint, empathy for others and the unique personality and character of each person. To do this, education must be a personal, even spiritual encounter and interaction between human beings, between teacher and learner.\n\nThe teachings of Buddhism employ the analogy of flowering fruit trees\u2014cherry, plum, peach, and damson\u2014each blossoming and bearing fruit in its own unique way, to express the value of diversity. Each living thing, in other words, has a distinct character, individuality, and purpose in this world. Accordingly, people should develop their own unique capabilities as they work to build a world of cooperation where all people acknowledge both their differences and their fundamental equality, a world where a rich diversity of peoples and cultures is nourished, each enjoying respect and harmony.\n\nThe late Dr. David L. Norton, the respected American philosopher who was well versed in the educational philosophy of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, shared his view of the Buddhist model of diversity in a 1991 address:\n\n\u201cFor the reorganized world that must come, our responsibility as educators is to cultivate in our students a sensibility of respect and appreciation of cultures, beliefs, and practices that differ from their own. This can only be done on the basis of the recognition that other cultures, beliefs, and practices embody aspects of truth and goodness, as the blossoms of the cherry tree, the sour plum, the sweet plum, and the pear tree each embody beauty in a distinctive aspect. To achieve this means that our students must abandon the supposition that the beliefs and practices with which they are most familiar have a monopoly on truth and goodness. This supposition is called parochialism, or narrow-mindedness when it is the innocent result of ignorance, but it breeds the aggressive absolutism of the \u2018closed society\u2019 mentality.\u201d*1\n\nSoon after World War II, as the East\u2013West ideological confrontation escalated, second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda spoke of the underlying unity of the human race, calling for the realization of a \u201cglobal family.\u201d His appeal grew from the same roots as what today is called \u201cworld citizenship\u201d and sought to transcend the constraints of self-centered and bigoted nationalism. There are, of course, those who believe a clash of civilizations to be unavoidable. My view is that such a clash would not occur between civilizations, but between the savage elements that lurk within each civilization. If people from different cultural traditions are willing to work over time to build tolerant and enduring links, rather than indulging in the temptation to dominate and forcibly influence others, the very nature of culture is such that humanity will be enriched by their interaction, and their differences will give birth to new values.\n\nThe role of religion must be to provide the wisdom which can propel the effort toward mutual development and improvement. In this connection, Buddhism teaches that one meaning of myo (mystic) is \u201cto open\u201d (cf. WND-1, 145). The constant seeking after improvement and growth, the desire to open up latent potentialities, is a special characteristic of human life. What is urgently sought today is religion that responds to this desire for growth and fulfillment.\n\nThe sad historical reality, however, is one of endless strife, bloodshed, and tragedy originating from religion and religious differences. As Nichiren wrote, \u201cThe true path [of life] lies in the affairs of this world\u201d (WND-1, 1126). I interpret this as meaning that if we are to avoid repeating the errors of the past, religions must give first priority to serving the needs of real people in their daily lives and finding solutions to the problems facing human society. In this way, they must provide the spiritual basis for peaceful competition.\n\nA hopeful future can be opened up by overcoming what Toda criticized as narrow self-centeredness and by promoting the humanitarian competition that Makiguchi advocated, the shared work of value-creation among people committed to living together as global neighbors. Indeed, this is the core objective of the SGI\u2019s movement of what we call \u201chuman revolution.\u201d\n\nFrom a peace proposal commemorating the 23rd SGI Day, January 26, 1998.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1\u201cHuman Education for World Citizenship\u201d (address to the Education Division of the Soka Gakkai in Osaka, October 22, 1991).\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 6: The Principle of \u201cCherry, Plum, Peach, and Damson\u201d [6.9]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.1]"}, {"title": "chapter-7-1.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.1]\n7.1 \u201c\u2018Joy\u2019 Means That Oneself and Others Together Experience Joy\u201d\nBuddhism teaches that we should strive for the mutual happiness of ourselves and others, without sacrificing the interests of either. President Ikeda has consistently affirmed that happiness must be mutual and that we must not seek our happiness at the expense of others.\n\nIn this selection, referring to the writings of Nichiren Daishonin, President Ikeda explains how we should aim to live as Buddhists pursuing happiness for both ourselves and others based on compassion and wisdom.\nNichiren Daishonin declares: \u201c\u2018Joy\u2019 means that oneself and others together experience joy. . . . Both oneself and others together will take joy in their possession of wisdom and compassion\u201d (OTT, 146).\n\nBoth ourselves and others matter. Caring only about one\u2019s own happiness is selfish. Claiming to care only about the happiness of others is hypocritical. Real \u201cjoy\u201d lies in both ourselves and others becoming happy together.\n\nSecond Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda said: \u201cBecoming happy yourself is no great challenge; it\u2019s quite simple. But the essence of Nichiren Buddhism lies in helping others become happy, too.\u201d*1\n\nThe passage I just quoted from the Daishonin plainly states that true happiness means possessing both wisdom and compassion\u2014in other words, the life state of Buddhahood. If one has wisdom but lacks compassion, one\u2019s life will be closed and constricted. Such wisdom, then, is not genuine. To have compassion but lack wisdom or behave in a foolish manner is to be of no help to anyone, including oneself. And compassion that is incapable of helping anyone cannot be said to be genuine.\n\nOnly faith in the Mystic Law encompasses both wisdom and compassion. The Daishonin clearly states: \u201cNow, when Nichiren and his followers chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, they are expressing joy in the fact that they will inevitably become Buddhas eternally endowed with the three bodies\u201d*2 (OTT, 146). This in itself is \u201cthe greatest of all joys\u201d (OTT, 212).\n\nMr. Toda maintained that \u201cindividual happiness and social prosperity must go hand in hand.\u201d The individual happiness referred to here is not self-centered; rather, it means cultivating true humanity\u2014developing into a person who possesses wisdom and compassion and helping others do the same.\n\nThe Lotus Sutra (Nam-myoho-renge-kyo) has the power to actualize both individual happiness and social prosperity.\n\nFrom The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra, vol. 5, published in Japanese in September 1999.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Translated from Japanese.

The three bodies are the Dharma body, the reward body, and the manifested body. The Dharma body is the fundamental truth, or Law, to which a Buddha is enlightened.

We need to extend a healing hand to such individuals. Through such efforts, we in fact heal ourselves.\n\nWhen beset by some misfortune, people tend to think that no one could possibly be as unhappy or unlucky as they are. They feel sorry for themselves and become blind to everything but their own situation. They wallow in their suffering, feeling dissatisfied and hopeless, which only saps their life force further.\n\nAt such times, what gives someone the strength to go on living? It seems to me that it is human bonds\u2014the desire to live for the sake of others. As long as we are wrapped up in ourselves, there is no happiness. When we courageously take action for others, the wellspring of our own life is replenished.\n\nWhen we look after and care for others\u2014that is, help others draw forth their life force\u2014our own life force increases. When we help people expand their state of life, our state of life also expands. That is the wonderful thing about the bodhisattva way. The practice for benefiting others is one and the same with the practice for benefiting ourselves.\n\nTo only speak of benefiting others leads to arrogance. It conveys a sense of self-righteousness, as if we are somehow doing others a favor by \u201csaving\u201d them. Only when we recognize that our efforts on others\u2019 behalf are also for our own sake will we be filled with humble appreciation for being able to develop our lives.\n\nOur lives and the lives of others are ultimately inseparable. It is vital, therefore, that we follow the bodhisattva way.\n\nFrom The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra, vol. 4, published in Japanese in December 1998.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.1]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.3]"}, {"title": "chapter-7-3.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.3]\n7.3 The Path of Mutual Respect and Growth\nThe aim of Buddhism is the pursuit of happiness, a life of mutual elevation in which we seek happiness together with others, respecting and supporting one another as fellow seekers.\nBuddhism is the pursuit of happiness. The purpose of faith is to become happy; we carry out Buddhist practice for the sake of our own happiness.\n\nAniruddha, one of Shakyamuni\u2019s ten major disciples, known as the foremost in divine insight, once dozed off while Shakyamuni was preaching. Deeply reflecting on his behavior, he vowed never to sleep again. As a result of his unremitting practice, he eventually went blind. Later, though, he is said to have opened his mind\u2019s eye and thereby gained extraordinary powers of discernment.\n\nOne day, Aniruddha attempted to mend a tear in his robe. However, because he could not see, he was unable to thread the sewing needle. In his frustration, he muttered: \u201cIs there no one who will thread this needle for me and so gain good fortune [from helping a practitioner of Buddhism]?\u201d\n\nSomeone approached him and said: \u201cAllow me to accumulate good fortune.\u201d\n\nAniruddha was stunned. For it was unmistakably the voice of Shakyamuni.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly trouble you,\u201d he protested, adding: \u201cSurely one such as yourself, World-Honored One, does not need to gain any benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, Aniruddha,\u201d Shakyamuni responded, \u201cthere is no greater seeker of happiness in the world than myself.\u201d*1\n\nShakyamuni went on to teach Aniruddha, who was still not convinced by his words, that there are things that one must continue to pursue eternally. For instance, in seeking truth, there is never an end, a point where we can say, \u201cThis will do.\u201d Similarly, in our efforts to lead others to enlightenment, there is no limit at which we can say, \u201cI have done enough.\u201d The same goes for our practice to develop and perfect ourselves.\n\nThe pursuit of happiness also has no bounds. Shakyamuni told Aniruddha: \u201cOf all the powers in the world, and in the realms of heaven or human beings, the power of good fortune is foremost. The Buddha way, too, is attained through the power of good fortune.\u201d*2\n\nShakyamuni\u2019s words \u201cThere is no greater seeker of happiness in the world than myself\u201d have important meaning.\n\nBuddhism is not about turning one\u2019s back on life or escaping reality, or acting as if one has already attained enlightenment and risen above considerations of happiness and unhappiness. In particular, thinking oneself alone to be special has nothing to do with Buddhism.\n\nRather, genuine practitioners of Buddhism are those who, as humble seekers of happiness, earnestly pursue their Buddhist practice together with and in the same way as everyone else. They take action with courage and joy, more determined than anyone to never pass up an opportunity to accumulate good fortune. Such people never arrogantly think, \u201cThis is good enough,\u201d but continue to exert themselves out of a desire to gain still more fortune and benefit and to develop a state of eternal happiness. The spirit of Buddhism pulses in this resolve to keep improving and challenging oneself without end.\n\nShakyamuni\u2019s simple offer to thread Aniruddha\u2019s needle conveys his infinitely profound spirit and attitude toward life. His conduct is a natural expression of his egalitarian philosophy to regard his fellow practitioners as equals.\n\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, the Daishonin states: \u201cIt is like the situation when one faces a mirror and makes a bow of obeisance: the image in the mirror likewise makes a bow of obeisance to oneself\u201d (OTT, 165).\n\nBelieving in others\u2019 Buddha nature, we respect and treasure them from the bottom of our hearts. When we treat others in this manner, the Buddha nature within them responds, on a fundamental level, with respect toward us in return.\n\nBroadly speaking, when we interact with others with true sincerity, more often than not they will come to respect and value us as well. And this is all the more so when our actions are based on prayer\u2014chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.\n\nConversely, denigrating others only leads to being denigrated oneself. And those whose lives are tainted by feelings of hate toward others will come to be reviled by others in turn.\n\nLet us open the path to mutual respect and harmonious coexistence so as to bring an end to this vicious circle that has long been part of human destiny.\n\nFrom a speech at a European representatives conference, Germany, June 11, 1992.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Translated from Japanese.

He composed them for ordinary people who lived off the land, and for the young boys and girls who would inherit the future.\n\nToday, I would like to share with you one of those stories, titled \u201cThree Questions.\u201d\n\nThe story concerns an emperor who, in directing the affairs of state, finds himself wondering about three questions.\n\nThe first question is, When is the best time to start a task? How do I know the right time for every action, so that I have no regrets?\n\nThe second question is, What kind of person do I need most? What kind of person should I pay attention to?\n\nThe third question is, What affairs or tasks are the most important?\n\nThe emperor very much wants to know the answers to these questions, because he is sure that if he has the answers, he will be able to succeed in everything he does. He makes it known throughout the land that he will richly reward anyone who can tell him the right answers to these questions. Many learned people come to see him, and they offer many answers. But the emperor is not convinced by any of them.\n\nThe learned are not necessarily wise.\n\nI will leave out the details of the story, but in the end the emperor gains the true answers to his questions from a sage who lives among the people.\n\nThis wise man replies that the most important time is now, this very moment; the most important person is the one in front of you right now; and the most important task is doing good to others, caring about others\u2019 happiness.\n\nThis moment, this instant is important, not some unknown time in the future. Today, this very day, is what matters. We must put our entire beings into the present\u2014for future victory is contained in this moment.\n\nLikewise, we do not need to look for special people in some far-off place. People are not made important simply by virtue of their power, learning, fame, or riches. The most important people are those in our immediate environment right now. They are the people we must value. Wise individuals consider the unique characteristics of those around them and make it possible for them to bring out their full potential. This is also the way to win the trust and respect of everyone.\n\nWhenever I travel abroad, I always endeavor to sincerely greet and connect with the very first people I meet after getting off the plane\u2014and then do the same with all those I meet thereafter. This is how my efforts to foster friendship start.\n\nIt is not important whether you are unknown or unremarkable in the world\u2019s eyes. What matters is that you know you have done your best, in a way that is true to yourself, for the sake of others, for your friends, and for people in society at large. Those who can declare that with confidence are champions of the human spirit, champions of life.\n\nFrom a speech at an Asian commemorative general meeting, Hong Kong, May 16, 1993.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.3]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.5]"}, {"title": "chapter-7-5.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.5]\n7.5 We Are Enriched by Helping Others\nBuddhism is the way to happiness for both self and others, and to victory for all. Serving others as we pursue that aim enriches us as human beings and becomes a precious personal treasure.\nWhile sowing the seeds of happiness in the life of one person after another may seem like a long, roundabout process, it is actually the most fundamental groundwork for changing our planet as a whole.\n\nAlthough it takes a long time for a tree to grow from a tiny seed, when it does grow big and tall, it will bear abundant flowers and fruit, and people will find rest in its cool shade. Each of us must strive to become such a tall tree.\n\nNichiren Buddhism is the path for attaining happiness for ourselves and others. It advocates neither sacrificing others nor sacrificing ourselves. It may be noble to sacrifice oneself for others, but it is not something we can expect of everyone. If we did, it would lead to a very unnatural situation.\n\nOur real aim is the happiness of both ourselves and others. We need a path that empowers everyone to be a victor in life. That means, while we strive for others\u2019 happiness, we do so with a deep sense of appreciation for them\u2014\u201cAll of my struggles to help him have made me into a much better person. How wonderful!\u201d \u201cThe efforts I made to support her have made me so much stronger. How grateful I am!\u201d The fact is, the harder we strive for kosen-rufu, the greater the good fortune and wisdom we will acquire. Soka Gakkai activities benefit others and ourselves at the same time.\n\nFor example, you meet and talk with someone, you chant for someone\u2019s happiness, or you write a postcard or letter to someone. Perhaps someone you arranged to meet didn\u2019t show up, but you continue to stay in touch and meet with them again and again. These may seem like small things, and you may sometimes feel you\u2019re not getting anywhere. But when you look back later, you\u2019ll see that none of your efforts were wasted. You\u2019ll see that going to meet others and encouraging them has made you a stronger, bigger person. You\u2019ll discover that chanting for a friend\u2019s happiness has enriched your own life enormously. The more time passes\u201410 years, 20 years on\u2014the more you\u2019ll see that your every action has become a precious treasure for you.\n\nAnd the day will come when those you have reached out to will show their appreciation. Someday they will happily tell others that you helped them stand up in faith or become the people they are today.\n\nYour aim is to play that role in the lives of as many people as you can. There is no greater treasure in life than this.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth II, published in Japanese in September 2000.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.4]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.6]"}, {"title": "chapter-7-6.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.6]\n7.6 The Bodhisattva Practice of Respecting All People\nIn his dialogue with Brazilian Academy of Letters president and renowned journalist Austreg\u00e9silo de Athayde, President Ikeda discusses the actions of the bodhisattva as taught in the Lotus Sutra and the significance of the bodhisattva way in Buddhism.\nOur happiness does not exist apart from the happiness of others. The Buddhist\u2019s foundation for action is the spirit of compassion. Compassion has two aspects\u2014relieving suffering and providing ease. It seeks to eliminate people\u2019s anxieties and fears and impart joy, reassurance, and hope.\n\nAs a Buddhist\u2014and, indeed, as a human being\u2014taking action for people\u2019s happiness is only natural. But sometimes the simplest things can be the most difficult. The essence of the teachings of Buddhism is simple: treasure each person. A Buddha is one who strives and works tirelessly for the happiness of every single individual.\n\nIn Buddhism, those whose actions are based on the spirit of benefiting others, or altruism, are called bodhisattvas. Numerous bodhisattvas appear in the Buddhist scriptures\u2014for instance, Manjushri, Universal Worthy, Maitreya, Perceiver of the World\u2019s Sounds, and Medicine King, to name but a few. Each of these bodhisattvas uses their unique qualities to serve living beings, working to protect and save them from various forms of suffering and misfortune. For example, Manjushri does so with wisdom, Universal Worthy with learning, and Maitreya with compassion. Perceiver of the World\u2019s Sounds relieves the sufferings of living beings through his power to perceive what is taking place in the world. Medicine King, as his name indicates, cures illnesses with beneficial medicines.\n\nOf all the many bodhisattvas, Nichiren Daishonin focuses on Bodhisattva Never Disparaging in the Lotus Sutra as a model for practice. As the bodhisattva\u2019s name indicates, he never disparages anyone, showing the highest respect for all.\n\nIn the Lotus Sutra, Bodhisattva Never Disparaging greets people respectfully, saying: \u201cI have profound reverence for you, I would never dare treat you with disparagement or arrogance. Why? Because you will all practice the bodhisattva way and will then be able to attain buddhahood\u201d (LSOC20, 308). This is a distillation of the Lotus Sutra\u2019s spirit of respect for the dignity of all human beings. As described in the sutra, Bodhisattva Never Disparaging presses his hands together in reverence and bows to all whom he meets.\n\nNichiren Daishonin identifies the actions of Bodhisattva Never Disparaging as the essence of the practice of Buddhism, writing: \u201cThe heart of the Buddha\u2019s lifetime of teachings is the Lotus Sutra, and the heart of the practice of the Lotus Sutra is found in the \u2018[Bodhisattva] Never Disparaging\u2019 chapter\u201d (WND-1, 851\u201352).\n\nThe behavior of Bodhisattva Never Disparaging is based on his conviction that all living beings are noble because they possess the Buddha nature. By revealing their Buddha nature\u2014the universal nobility or dignity inherent within them\u2014any and every individual can open the way to an unparalleled life. Advancing on this path together with others is the practice of the bodhisattva way.\n\n\nFrom A Dialogue on Human Rights in the 21st Century, published in Japanese in February 1995.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.5]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.7]"}, {"title": "chapter-7-7.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.7]\n7.7 Accumulating Treasures of the Heart\nThe bodhisattva way constitutes what is most important in life and the supreme memory that we engrave in our lives.\nBy helping others become happy, we, too, become happy. This is also a tenet of psychology. How can those who have lost the will to live under the weight of inconsolable suffering or deep emotional wounds get back on their feet? All too often, the more they dwell on their problem, the more depressed and discouraged they become. But, by going to support and help someone else who is also suffering, they can regain the will to live. Taking action out of concern for others enables them to heal themselves.\n\nThere are many people in the world who feel that working for others\u2019 welfare is not worth the effort. Some even view the merest mention of charity and compassion with derision. Such arrogant disregard for others causes untold suffering in society.\n\nAn American missionary supposedly once asked Mahatma Gandhi: \u201cWhat religion do you practice and what form do you think religion will take in India in the future?\u201d Two sick people happened to be resting in the room. Pointing in their direction, Gandhi replied simply: \u201cMy religion is serving and working for the people. I am not preoccupied with the future.\u201d*1 For Gandhi, politics and government were also a matter of service and, as Rabindranath Tagore said, of helping \u201cthe most destitute.\u201d*2\n\nIt\u2019s all about action. In essence, altruistic bodhisattva practice is the very heart of religion, of Buddhism, and also of humane government and education.\n\nWe have a tremendous mission. The Daishonin writes: \u201cMore valuable than treasures in a storehouse are the treasures of the body, and the treasures of the heart are the most valuable of all\u201d (WND-1, 851). To focus only on the \u201ctreasures of the storehouse\u201d\u2014finances or the economy\u2014will not improve the economic situation. Things may improve for a while, but this will ultimately not contribute to the welfare of society. It is people, it is the heart, that matters most. The heart determines everything. When we possess the \u201ctreasures of the heart,\u201d when our lives overflow with good fortune and wisdom, we will naturally be endowed with abundant \u201ctreasures of the body\u201d and \u201ctreasures of the storehouse.\u201d\n\nWhat is left at the end of our lives? It is our memories, the memories that we have engraved in our hearts and minds.\n\nI met the Russian novelist Mikhail Sholokhov when I visited Moscow in 1974. He told me: \u201cWhen one lives to an old age, the most painful experiences in life become difficult to recall. The older one grows, the colors of the events in one\u2019s life fade and everything from the happiest times to the saddest starts to pass away.\u201d After pausing for a moment, he continued with a smile: \u201cWhen you turn 70, Mr. Ikeda, you will know that what I am saying is the truth.\u201d His words are profound, indeed.\n\nEverything passes. Both the soaring joys and crushing sorrows fade away and seem but like a dream. However, the memory of having lived one\u2019s life to the fullest never disappears. The memories of having worked wholeheartedly for kosen-rufu, in particular, are eternal.\n\nSurely all that remains and adorns our lives in the end is what we have done or contributed to the world in our lifetime in terms of how many people we have helped become happy, how many people appreciate us for having helped them change their lives for the better.\n\nThe Daishonin writes: \u201cSingle-mindedly chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and urge others to do the same; that will remain as the only memory of your present life in this human world\u201d (WND-1, 64).\n\nFrom The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra, vol. 5, published in Japanese in September 1999.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Translated from Japanese.

Many political leaders and celebrities pretend to be caring and altruistic, but how many are actually dedicating their lives to the welfare of others?\n\nOur members in the early days of our movement were virtually all poor. Most had no particular social status or higher education. But they possessed a lofty spirit. They were determined to help everyone they encountered become happy. They burned with a sense of great mission as trailblazers for humanity.\n\nThere is no nobler way of life than to be committed to helping others, to empowering them to become happy.\n\nI will never forget the words of one of the members who pioneered the movement for kosen-rufu in Peru: \u201cOther than my blood and my bones, what sustained me in this life was just my wish for the happiness of the people of Peru.\u201d Those were his last words.\n\nMr. Toda, said:\n\n\u201cYou can give food to the hungry and money to those in need, but you cannot distribute those things equally to all who are wanting. There is a limit to material aid. And the recipients may be glad, but they may also become dependent upon you and think they can continue to receive this support without any effort on their part. The greatest offering one can make is the offering of Buddhism. This allows people to gain fresh life force, enabling them to do their work and to become healthy again. This inner strength, like water welling up from the earth, is limitless.\u201d\n\nThis is, indeed, the supreme path of benefiting others.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth II, published in Japanese in September 2000.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.7]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.1]"}, {"title": "chapter-8-1.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.1]\n8.1 Struggling with Illness Can Forge Invincible Spiritual Strength\nBirth, aging, sickness, and death are challenges everyone must face. We are all likely to confront the challenge of illness at some time in our lives. Buddhism regards illness not as something to be feared but as an opportunity for the human revolution that leads to attaining the life state of Buddhahood. Through Buddhism, we are able to transform illness into a force for victory in life.\n\nIn this chapter, we explore President Ikeda\u2019s guidance on the subject of birth, aging, sickness, and death based on Buddhism.\nBuddhism recognizes illness as one of the fundamental sufferings that human beings experience\u2014one of the four sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death. In seeking a solution to illness, both Buddhism and medical science share a common goal. Both ask what is necessary for people to enjoy vibrant mental and physical well-being and to lead fulfilling lives.\n\nHealth is not simply the absence of illness. A truly healthy life is creative\u2014one in which we keep challenging something, creating something, and moving forward to expand our horizons as long as we live.\n\nMy mentor, second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda, said that people today make two basic mistakes: they confuse knowledge with wisdom and wrongly associate sickness with death.\n\nKnowledge and wisdom are not the same. The relationship between the two can be discussed from many perspectives.\n\nSpeaking very generally, we can say that medical science combats illness through knowledge. Buddhism, on the other hand, develops human wisdom so that we may balance our lives and strengthen our life force. By doing so, we can use medical knowledge as an aid in the process of healing ourselves.\n\nIt is therefore foolish to ignore or reject medical science. To do so on religious grounds would amount to fanaticism. We need to make intelligent use of medical knowledge to conquer illness, and Buddhism can help us bring forth the wisdom to do that effectively.\n\nWisdom is essential for both health and long life. It is also a vital ingredient for happiness. If we wish to create an age in which people enjoy good health, we must first create an age that is founded on wisdom.\n\nAs for the relationship between sickness and death, illness does not necessarily lead to death. Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cIllness gives rise to the resolve to attain the way\u201d (WND-1, 937). Just as he says, illness can motivate us to take stock of ourselves, to reflect on the essence of life and our way of living. Through struggling with illness, we can gain a much fuller understanding of life and forge invincible spiritual strength.\n\nI was a rather sickly child. Later, I also suffered from tuberculosis, and the doctor said I might not reach the age of 30. But that experience allowed me to understand the feelings of those afflicted with poor health. It also made me treasure every single moment, never waste a minute, and live with all my might, doing everything I could while alive.\n\nThere are many people with healthy bodies whose lives are ailing. And there are also those who suffer from physical illness but whose lives are vibrant. As long as we are alive, we are bound to experience illness of some kind. That\u2019s why having the wisdom to know how to deal successfully with illness is so important.\n\nFrom Kenko no chie (The Art of Health), published in Japanese in February 1997.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 7: Happiness for Both Ourselves and Others [7.8]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.2]"}, {"title": "chapter-8-2.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.2]\n8.2 Transforming the Sufferings of Birth, Aging, Sickness, and Death\nPresident Ikeda encourages members to resolve never to be defeated by illness and to strive for a life of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity.\nIllness is one of the four universal sufferings that no one can escape. In that sense, our entire lives are a battle against illness, so there\u2019s no need to fear it. By the same token, we shouldn\u2019t make light of illness. It\u2019s important to quickly take practical measures to get well.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cCould not this illness . . . be the Buddha\u2019s design, because the Vimalakirti and Nirvana sutras both teach that sick people will surely attain Buddhahood? Illness gives rise to the resolve to attain the way\u201d (WND-1, 937).\n\nWe can use the suffering of illness as fuel to strengthen our faith and also to develop a deeper and more expansive state of life. In the light of the Mystic Law and viewed from the perspective of eternity, the struggle against illness is a test to enable us to attain happiness and victory.\n\nTrue health is found in a positive attitude toward life that refuses to be defeated by anything.\n\nThe sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death can be transformed into a winning life imbued with the four noble virtues of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity. This is the life of Soka, or value creation.\n\nFalling ill is not a form of failure or defeat. It doesn\u2019t happen because our faith is weak. When the suffering of illness occurs amid our efforts for kosen-rufu, it is the working of devilish influences trying to obstruct our attainment of Buddhahood. As such, we mustn\u2019t let illness intimidate us. The Daishonin teaches us how to bring forth courage to face illness and attain Buddhahood in this lifetime.\n\nWhen you experience illness, the important thing is to rouse even stronger faith. Keep chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with the determination to make this illness an opportunity to demonstrate the tremendous power of faith and achieve truly amazing growth as a human being.\n\nThe Daishonin writes: \u201cNam-myoho-renge-kyo is like the roar of a lion. What sickness can therefore be an obstacle?\u201d (WND-1, 412).\n\nThe Mystic Law is the ultimate source of power for overcoming the sufferings of illness. It is the best of all medicines for our life. Mr. Toda often used to say: \u201cThe human body is one big pharmaceutical factory.\u201d\n\nIf you are suffering from illness, it is important to keep chanting earnestly and persistently for the treatment you are now receiving to yield its greatest possible effectiveness and for the great life force of the Buddha to manifest itself in your body and vanquish the devil of illness. If you base your struggle with illness on faith in the Mystic Law, you can definitely transform all poison into medicine.\n\nThe Daishonin teaches: \u201cMyo [of myoho, the Mystic Law] means to revive\u201d (WND-1, 149).\n\nIn a letter to a follower with a sick family member, he says: \u201c[This illness] cannot be the work of demons. Probably the ten demon daughters*1 [protective deities in Buddhism] are testing the strength of your faith\u201d (WND-1, 899). In other words, the benevolent forces of the universe cannot fail to protect the practitioners of the Mystic Law. He is telling the family: \u201cYou can overcome this!\u201d\n\nIn another letter, the Daishonin writes: \u201cThe sun breaks through the pitch-black dark,\u201d and \u201cThe Lotus Sutra is compared to the sun\u201d (WND-1, 315). As Soka Gakkai members who chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and base our lives on the Mystic Law, a bright sun of hope shines ever in our hearts. We can dispel all darkness and cast off even the heaviest chains of karma.\n\nIn struggling against illness for both ourselves and others, we can attain a state of shining health.\n\nChant daimoku, trusting in the power of the Gohonzon.

In the end, you are certain to triumph!\n\n*****\n\n[Concerning emotional or psychological disorders, such as depression:]\n\nLife is long, and there is no need to rush things. I think it\u2019s prudent in the case of psychological disorders to seek professional advice and take time to get proper care and treatment. Everyone\u2019s situation is different. There is no universal prescription or panacea. But there is one point I wish to emphasize: I can affirm that none of you who uphold the Mystic Law is destined to be unhappy.\n\nWe should warmly support and watch over those struggling with mental health issues, keeping their long-term welfare always in mind, and also sincerely encourage their family members. Those caring for others with emotional or psychological disorders face a great challenge, too, and they should try to find creative ways to take a break and refresh themselves.\n\nShowing care and support for those suffering from emotional illnesses will lead to the cultivation of a truly deep spirit of compassion and also to the creation of a richly humanistic society.\n\nThose who have experienced great suffering can develop into outstanding people. Those who have undergone painful trials can help many others. Such individuals have an important mission. This is the teaching of Nichiren Buddhism and the bodhisattva way of life.\n\nMr. Toda remarked: \u201cOutwardly, we might look like a \u2018Bodhisattva Poverty\u2019 or \u2018Bodhisattva Sickness,\u2019 but that is merely a role we\u2019re playing in the drama of life. We are in fact bona fide Bodhisattvas of the Earth!*2\u201d He also said: \u201cPeople who have battled serious illness really understand the profundity of life.\u201d\n\nEverything in life has a meaning.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cEven the jewels and treasures that fill the major world system are no substitute for life\u201d (WND-1, 1019). Though one may be ill, this has no bearing on the inherent nobility, dignity, and beauty of one\u2019s life.

But being ill doesn\u2019t mean one has to be unhappy or that one can\u2019t take action for kosen-rufu. Those who embrace the Mystic Law are guaranteed to become happy.\n\nThe Swiss philosopher and educator Carl Hilty said: \u201cSickness is . . . just a passageway to a higher step in life.\u201d*1\n\nThose who have experienced illness themselves are more considerate of others. The experience of illness makes us more compassionate. Illness teaches us many things. It makes us look death in the face and think about the meaning of life. It makes us realize just how precious life is. It is all just a passageway leading us upward to a more elevated life. It is a learning experience. And for those who base themselves on the Mystic Law, everything becomes energy for creating happiness, fuel for self-improvement.\n\nMr. Toda said with great conviction: \u201c[The benefit of the Gohonzon] is that it supercharges our life force. Such powerfully charged life force transforms a state of mind in which we grumble and complain about our problems, suffering, poverty, and other misfortunes into a state of mind filled with light and joy.\u201d He also said: \u201cThe power of daimoku is colossal.

Hinrichs\u2019sche Buchhandlung, 1907), p. 71.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.2]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.4]"}, {"title": "chapter-8-4.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.4]\n8.4 Turning Illness into an Impetus for Growth\nReferring to Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s writings, President Ikeda affirms that Buddhism enables us to make illness into a positive value as an opportunity to achieve absolute happiness.\nIt is said that those who overcome a major illness deeply savor the taste of life. In Nichiren Buddhism, illness is regarded as an impetus for achieving the supreme objective of Buddhahood. The misfortune of a severe illness can become the stepping stone to a state of absolute happiness that endures for all eternity.\n\nA famous passage from the Daishonin\u2019s writings states: \u201cCould not this illness of your husband\u2019s be the Buddha\u2019s design, because the Vimalakirti and Nirvana sutras both teach that sick people will surely attain Buddhahood? Illness gives rise to the resolve to attain the way\u201d (WND-1, 937). With these words, the Daishonin warmly encourages a female follower whose husband is suffering from illness. This guidance conveys his boundless and freely flowing wisdom and compassion.\n\nIt is certainly true that a painful illness can motivate us to begin chanting daimoku more earnestly and abundantly than usual. Such times of suffering are precisely when we need to make the flame of our faith burn higher than ever. What matters is whether we make our illness a starting point for embarking on a course to greater happiness, or the beginning of a decline toward misery.\n\nThe power of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo not only produces a strong life force to help us overcome illness, but also transforms the karma in the depths of our being. It elevates our inner \u201cself\u201d to the world of Buddhahood and enables us to attain immeasurable good fortune that leads to an indestructible state of absolute happiness.\n\nWe can then brilliantly transform the negative condition of illness beyond the neutral condition of health into a more expansive, positive condition\u2014moving our lives in the direction of happiness. What enables us to draw forth that power is indomitable faith\u2014faith that can courageously turn even adversity into a springboard for tremendous growth.\n\nOf course, faith cannot immediately cure every kind of illness. Each person has their own karma, and the strength of each person\u2019s faith also differs. In addition, a struggle with illness can have a variety of profound meanings that cannot be fathomed by ordinary wisdom.\n\nAs long as we have strong faith, however, there is not the slightest doubt that we can transform our condition in the direction of health, happiness, and Buddhahood. From the perspective of life existing throughout the three existences of past, present, and future, we can move our life in the best possible direction, in the direction of happiness.\n\nIt is important to continue chanting earnestly and to keep our passionate commitment to kosen-rufu burning brightly in our hearts as long as we live. Such strong, thoroughly forged determination in faith is the primary force for serenely overcoming the sufferings of birth and death.\n\nFrom a speech at a Wakayama Prefecture commemorative general meeting, Wakayama, March 24, 1988.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.3]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.5]"}, {"title": "chapter-8-5.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.5]\n8.5 Falling Ill Is Not a Sign of Defeat\nIllness is not a sign of defeat or misfortune. For those dedicated to the Mystic Law, the drama of birth, aging, sickness, and death is also the joyous stage for a life of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity.\nMr. Toda said: \u201cIt is natural for us to fall ill. At the same time, we possess within us the power to cure our own illness.\u201d This was a message he often shared.\n\nNichiren Daishonin states that birth, aging, sickness, and death are \u201cthe aspect or characteristics of the threefold world\u201d*1 (OTT, 127). Illness itself is just one aspect of human life. Falling ill is by no means a sign of defeat in life. Moreover, it would be utterly lacking in compassion to presume that someone\u2019s faith is weak simply because they have gotten sick. Offering heartfelt encouragement to those who are battling illness is an expression of genuine caring. Whenever one of his followers fell ill, the Daishonin would encourage that person with all his heart and being.\n\nThe \u201clion\u2019s roar\u201d of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the ultimate weapon for battling illness. We must absolutely never forget the Daishonin\u2019s statement \u201cNam-myoho-renge-kyo is like the roar of a lion. What sickness can therefore be an obstacle?\u201d (WND-1, 412).\n\nTo use the struggle against illness to develop an even greater sense of fulfillment and inner richness is to lead a life of value creation. That is why it is so important to have the \u201cheart of a lion king\u201d with which to fight through to the end against all obstacles. We must possess an indomitable and unyielding spirit. It is for this very reason that we need to exert ourselves in faith and practice every day, chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo for both ourselves and others, and forge a strong determination grounded in faith that will remain steadfast and unwavering in the face of any attack by the devil of illness.\n\nWhen the lay nun Toki, the wife of Toki Jonin, became seriously ill, the Daishonin repeatedly sent her letters of encouragement, seeking to impart hope and strength.*2 \u201cDo not burden your mind with grief\u201d (WND-1, 656), he tells her. The important thing is to have a fighting spirit, to possess the spirit of a votary of the Lotus Sutra. He also says: \u201cTake care of yourself\u201d (WND-1, 656). It is vital that we take practical steps toward restoring our health when we are ill.\n\nNo one intends from the outset to be defeated by illness. But should a particular illness interfere with our daily activities or our work, or cause us to lose courage and self-confidence, we may gradually be overtaken by despair. In the case of the lay nun Toki, she may have begun to feel a sense of resignation because of her slow recovery. The Daishonin urges her to summon the resolve to live out her life to the fullest.\n\nOf course, there are people who have strong faith but who die young. However, there is definitely some profound meaning behind this. The value of one\u2019s life is not determined by the number of years one has lived. The Daishonin asserts: \u201cIt is better to live a single day with honor than to live to 120 and die in disgrace\u201d (WND-1, 851).\n\nThe Daishonin speaks of \u201cthe treasure of faith\u201d (WND-1, 955), emphasizing to the lay nun Toki the importance of rousing the will to go on living, or, we might say, enthusiasm for life.*3\n\nFor us, each day of life is a day that we can directly contribute to kosen-rufu; our efforts each day lead directly to the fulfillment of the great vow for kosen-rufu. Therefore, we absolutely must not be defeated by illness or any other obstacle.\n\nThe Daishonin says that illness is \u201cthe Buddha\u2019s design,\u201d because it can spur us to arouse the \u201cresolve to attain the way\u201d (WND-1, 937).*4\n\nThe ultimate purpose for living long and healthy lives is so that we can take compassionate action to benefit others who are struggling amid the realities of society. It is only natural, of course, that we chant for good health and longevity for our own sakes as well. Needless to say, to ruin one\u2019s health on account of immoderate habits or plain neglect runs entirely counter to a way of life of value creation.\n\nWe have to exercise wisdom in our daily lives\u2014for example, taking time to refresh ourselves and resting if we become fatigued. Good health is something we have to secure for ourselves by acting with prudence and good sense. Health is the badge of honor of the wise.\n\nWhat is the purpose of striving for good health and longevity? It is so that we can use our lives to the fullest to work for the sake of the Law, for the happiness and welfare of our families, our fellow members, and our fellow human beings, and to accomplish our individual missions and realize the great vow for kosen-rufu.\n\nIt is vital therefore that we actively take on the challenges of the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death amid our efforts for kosen-rufu. Doing so is actual proof that the four noble virtues of Buddhahood\u2014eternity, happiness, true self, and purity\u2014exist eternally within us.\n\nThe sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death are not causes for lamenting. Rather, they together form the brilliant stage of life upon which we enact a drama that resounds with the triumphant strains of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity. Through this drama of birth, aging, sickness, and death, we perform a joyous play of human victory.\n\nFrom The World of Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s Writings, vol. 3, published in Japanese in March 2005.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Threefold world: The world of unenlightened beings who transmigrate within the six paths (from hell through the realm of heavenly beings). The threefold world consists of, in ascending order, the world of desire, the world of form, and the world of formlessness. In a general sense, it refers to the saha world in which we dwell.\n*2The Daishonin writes: \u201cYou also are a practitioner of the Lotus Sutra, and your faith is like the waxing moon or the rising tide. Be deeply convinced, then, that your illness cannot possibly persist, and that your life cannot fail to be extended! Take care of yourself, and do not burden your mind with grief\u201d (WND-1, 656).\n*3The Daishonin writes: \u201cLife is the most precious of all treasures. Even one extra day of life is worth more than ten million ryo of gold. . . . So you must hasten to accumulate the treasure of faith and quickly conquer your illness\u201d (WND-1, 955). A ryo was a unit of weight in ancient Japan. One ryo was equivalent to about 37.5 grams, though the exact weight differed according to the historical period.\n*4 The Daishonin writes: \u201cAnd could not this illness of your husband\u2019s be the Buddha\u2019s design, because the Vimalakirti and Nirvana sutras both teach that sick people will surely attain Buddhahood? Illness gives rise to the resolve to attain the way\u201d (WND-1, 937).\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.4]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.6]"}, {"title": "chapter-8-6.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.6]\n8.6 The Buddhist View of Illness\nIn this excerpt from The New Human Revolution, the novel\u2019s protagonist Shin\u2019ichi Yamamoto (whose character represents President Ikeda) encourages men\u2019s division members suffering from poor health during a visit to Kansai.\nShin\u2019ichi said: \u201cThe \u2018Life Span\u2019 (16th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra teaches the principle of prolonging one\u2019s life through faith.*1 In other words, through our Buddhist practice, we can extend how long we live. If we continue to strive with strong faith in the Mystic Law, there is no illness that we cannot surmount. Please chant abundantly and live a long, healthy life! . . .\n\n\u201cIn discussing the origins of illness, the Daishonin cites a passage from T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai\u2019s Great Concentration and Insight, which states: \u2018There are six causes of illness: (1) disharmony of the four elements; (2) improper eating or drinking; (3) inappropriate practice of seated meditation; (4) attack by demons; (5) the work of devils; and (6) the effects of karma\u2019 (WND-1, 631).\u201d\n\nLet us look at these points in closer detail.\n\nListed as the first cause of illness is \u201cdisharmony of the four elements.\u201d The four elements are earth, water, fire, and wind. According to traditional Eastern thought, nature and all things in the universe, including the human body, are made up of these four elements. \u201cDisharmony of the four elements\u201d refers to unseasonable weather and other conditions of discord in the natural world, which have a powerful influence on the human body and can cause various illnesses.\n\nThe second and third causes of illness\u2014\u201cimproper eating or drinking\u201d and \u201cinappropriate practice of seated meditation\u201d*2\u2014refer to a lack of control in one\u2019s dietary habits and other aspects of day-to-day living. When our daily lives fall out of rhythm, our diet may suffer. Also, insufficient sleep and exercise may cause disorders in our internal organs, muscles, or nervous system.\n\nThe \u201cdemons\u201d in number four\u2014\u201cattack by demons\u201d\u2014refer to external causes. These include microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses, as well as the stress we experience in our daily lives.\n\nNumber five, \u201cthe work of devils,\u201d indicates the various inner impulses and desires that disrupt the healthy functioning of our minds and bodies. Afflictions that prevent us from practicing Buddhism also arise from the workings of such negative functions.\n\nNumber six, \u201cthe work of karma,\u201d refers to causes that derive from the inner depths of our lives. This indicates sickness that stems from distortions or deeply rooted tendencies in our lives. Buddhism views such distortions as karma.\n\nThe origins of illness are divided into these six different categories, but in actuality, many illnesses have overlapping causes. In the case of influenza, for example, the cause is a virus. This could be looked at as an \u201cattack by demons.\u201d Infection can, however, be triggered by changeable weather\u2014in other words, by \u201cdisharmony of the four elements.\u201d In addition, a poor physical condition brought about by an unhealthy lifestyle\u2014\u201cimproper eating and drinking\u201d\u2014can be a contributing factor. Negative functions may also be at work in the depths of one\u2019s life to keep one from engaging in Buddhist practice, and there are also cases when karma may be an important consideration.\n\nShin\u2019ichi went on to give a detailed explanation of the six causes of illness in light of the Daishonin\u2019s writings: \u201cIn short, one of the first steps in avoiding illness is taking care to dress appropriately for the weather and environment. Leading a well-balanced life, not overindulging in food or drink, and getting enough sleep and exercise are all vital, too.\n\n\u201cIn this way, we can avoid the first three causes of illness. Faith means employing the wisdom to do so. And with the help of medical science, we can also avoid the fourth cause of illness, which includes such things as germs and viruses. But no matter what the sickness, the speed with which we recover depends upon our life force. And faith is the wellspring of that life force.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, if the root cause of an illness is the work of negative functions or the effect of karma, then even the best efforts of medical science alone cannot bring about a cure. It is only through strong faith in the Gohonzon that we can defeat such negative functions in our life and transform our karma.\u201d\n\n*****\n\n[The following is in response to a diabetic man taking daily insulin injections. The man said that he had lost all hope in life because his doctor has told him he would never be cured.]\n\nShin\u2019ichi said: \u201cIf you exert yourself wholeheartedly in faith, your life will be filled with hope, supreme happiness, and fulfillment, even if you have a chronic illness. The Daishonin writes: \u2018Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is like the roar of a lion. What sickness can therefore be an obstacle?\u2019 (WND-1, 412). Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is a lion\u2019s roar. A lion\u2019s roar will send even the fiercest animals running. In the same way, when faced with chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, no ailment can be an obstacle to one\u2019s happiness or to kosen-rufu.\n\n\u201cPeople today have been described as being only \u2018half-healthy,\u2019 meaning that we are all afflicted with some kind of illness and that our physical health will decline as we age. But is sickness necessarily the cause of unhappiness? Absolutely not. It is being defeated by illness and losing hope that makes us unhappy. We become unhappy when we forget our mission to strive for kosen-rufu.\n\n\u201cThere are many people with perfectly healthy bodies who are unhappy because they are ailing spiritually. On the other hand, there are many Soka Gakkai members who, while struggling with illness or disability, are not only genuinely happy but also work for the happiness of others.\n\n\u201cAt life\u2019s most fundamental level, health and sickness are one. There are times when we manifest a healthy condition and times when we manifest illness. The two conditions are interconnected. Thus, by making earnest efforts in faith and fighting against illness, we can establish a state of genuine health both mentally and physically.\n\n\u201cIt may be hard to have to take insulin injections for the rest of your life. But if you think about it, eating and sleeping are also things we must do every day to live. Try to view your injections as just one more thing that\u2019s been added to your daily routine. It won\u2019t do any good to let it get you down.\n\n\u201cI hope you will live in such a way that others struggling with the same condition will marvel and say: \u2018Look how energetic he is, despite his diabetes!\u2019 \u2018Look at what a long life he is enjoying!\u2019 \u2018Look how happy he is!\u2019 If you are able to do that, you will be a brilliant example of the power of Buddhism. That is your mission in life. Don\u2019t allow yourself to be defeated. Keep going! Never give up!\u201d\n\nShin\u2019ichi then addressed all present, saying: \u201cThe Daishonin will not fail to protect those who dedicate their lives to kosen-rufu. When his disciple Nanjo Tokimitsu was ill, the Daishonin sent him a letter in which he wrote: \u2018You demons, by making this man suffer, are you trying to swallow a sword point first, or embrace a raging fire, or become the archenemy of the Buddhas of the ten directions in the three existences?\u2019 (WND-1, 1109). In sternly rebuking the devilish functions causing his disciple to suffer, the Daishonin protected him. We are all embraced by this great conviction and compassion of the Daishonin.\n\n\u201cI hope all of you will also be filled with certainty and indomitable resolve not to be defeated by those negative forces. Muster your courage. I also used to suffer from poor health and a doctor said I probably wouldn\u2019t make it to age 30. But I\u2019m strong and healthy now and able to handle the most demanding of schedules. You can all become healthy, too!\u201d\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 10, \u201cCrown Champions\u201d chapter.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Prolonging one\u2019s life through faith: This is based on the passage in the \u201cLife Span\u201d chapter of the Lotus Sutra that reads: \u201cWe beg you to cure us and let us live out our lives!\u201d (LSOC16, 269). This is in the section that explains the parable of the outstanding physician, who gives \u201cgood medicine\u201d to his children who have \u201cdrunk poison\u201d (that is, succumbed to delusion), and who implore him to cure their illness. Through taking this good medicine (that is, embracing faith in the wonderful Law of the Lotus Sutra), they are cured and able to enjoy many more years of life.\n*2The seated meditation referred to here is an ancient Indian practice for ordering the mind and body, later adopted by Buddhism. It involves sitting with correct posture, closing one\u2019s eyes, and thinking deeply. The Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai held that this practice, when improperly done or carried to an extreme, could cause illness.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.5]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.7]"}, {"title": "chapter-8-7.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.7]\n8.7 \u201cFaith\u201d Means to Continue to Believe until the Very End\nThis story of a young child who overcame the suffering of illness and the fear of death to create an inspiring drama shows us that no matter how ill we may be, through strong faith we can triumph in life in the end.\nThe law of life and death is universal, permeating the entire universe. But it manifests itself in distinct, unique ways that are different from person to person. It is very complex, involving innumerable factors.\n\nBuddhism teaches that our lives are governed to a large extent by our karma, which is formed by our actions in past lifetimes. We are subject to the effects of immutable karma (fixed karma), which determines how long we live and the basic course of our lives. We are also subject to the effects of mutable karma (unfixed karma), which we may or may not experience in this lifetime. If we compare these two types of karma to sickness, immutable karma is like a serious or even fatal disease, while mutable karma is like a relatively minor illness, such as a cold.\n\nThe word karma is Sanskrit for \u201caction.\u201d Our every action\u2014what we think, say, and do\u2014is engraved in our lives. Good actions produce good, fortunate results, and bad actions produce bad, unfortunate results. They are bound to manifest themselves eventually.\n\nThe energy, both positive and negative, that is engraved in our lives through our actions does not disappear at death. It continues into our next existence, carried over in a way we might think of as resembling the law of the conservation of energy in physics.\n\nBut Nichiren Buddhism teaches that we can change all such karma. We can transform even fixed karma\u2014or rather, we must do so. No matter what sufferings or hardships we may encounter, we must live out our lives fully, fighting our hardest until we triumph. Those who win in the end are true victors in life.\n\nVictory is not decided halfway through. If we win in the end, we can look back on everything in our life up to that moment and realize that it all had meaning. But if we are defeated in the end, everything will have been meaningless, no matter how smoothly things may have been going until then.\n\nIf members persevere with strong faith to the very end, they will be victorious, even if they should die from illness. There are many who, while suffering from illness, have chanted for kosen-rufu and the happiness of others and continued to reach out to encourage those around them right up to the very moment of death. Their lives and their bravery in the face of death have given courage and inspiration to countless others. Such people will quickly be reborn with healthy bodies.\n\nI knew a young girl who was diagnosed with a brain tumor at age 11 and died at 14. But throughout her illness, she was always happy and bright. She even cheered up the adults in the hospital with her sunny, positive presence. No doubt her illness caused her terrible pain, but she continued to chant daimoku and to encourage others.\n\nWhen she was near death, she said to one of her last visitors: \u201cI don\u2019t care about my illness anymore. I\u2019ve stopped chanting for myself. There are so many others worse off than me. I\u2019m chanting with all my heart that they will take faith as soon as possible and find out for themselves just how wonderful the Gohonzon is.\u201d\n\nTo her parents, she said brightly: \u201cWhat if this had happened to you, Dad? We\u2019d be in terrible trouble! And it would be just as bad if it had happened to you, Mom. And if it had happened to my little brother, I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle it. I\u2019m glad that it happened to me instead of any of you. . . . I\u2019m sure this is the result of a promise I made before I was born. If my life can somehow touch and inspire those who know me, I will be happy.\u201d\n\nHearing of this girl\u2019s struggle with illness, I sent her a bouquet of roses. I also sent her a Japanese fan on which I had written the words, \u201cLight of Happiness,\u201d and a photograph I had taken of a field of irises in bloom. I heard that she was thrilled when she received them.\n\nTo those around her, she left the words: \u201cFaith means to continue to believe until the very end.\u201d And she demonstrated those words with her own life.\n\nAt her funeral, a long line of people came to pay their respects. In her brief 14 years, she had told over a thousand people of the greatness of the Mystic Law.\n\nShe won. That\u2019s what I believe. Everything that happened to her had meaning. Or rather, through her struggle, she gave meaning to her suffering.\n\nShe said that her illness was the result of a promise she had made in her past lifetime. Buddhism teaches the concept of \u201cvoluntarily assuming the appropriate karma.\u201d*1 This is where practitioners of the Mystic Law voluntarily choose to be born into painful situations, so they might demonstrate the power of Buddhism to others through their struggles and subsequent triumph. This is the bodhisattva way of life.\n\nIf those who embrace the Mystic Law were blessed with every form of happiness from the start, no one would ever come to know how powerful and effective Nichiren Buddhism is. That\u2019s why we voluntarily choose to be born with problems and suffering so that we can show others what human revolution looks like. It is as if we are performing a part in a play, a great drama.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth II, published in Japanese in September 2000.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Voluntarily assuming the appropriate karma: This refers to bodhisattvas who, though qualified to receive the pure rewards of Buddhist practice, relinquish them and make a vow to be reborn in an impure world in order to save living beings. They spread the Mystic Law while undergoing the same sufferings as those born in the evil world due to karma. This term derives from Miao-lo\u2019s interpretation of relevant passages in \u201cThe Teacher of the Law\u201d (10th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.6]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.8]"}, {"title": "chapter-8-8.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.8]\n8.8 \u201cLaugh Off the Devil of Illness\u201d\nThe example of a women\u2019s division member who triumphed brilliantly over illness teaches the importance of never losing hope and employing strong faith to change winter into spring.\nOne day after a women\u2019s division meeting, I learned that a woman I knew well was going to be hospitalized. I had known her from her student days, and I also knew her parents.\n\nShe had developed a lump under her chin and gone to see the doctor about it. He examined her and, though a precise diagnosis would have to wait until further tests, he thought it was serious. She had always been in the best of health and very energetic and active, so this news surprised me. I could imagine how unsettling it must have been for her.\n\nI immediately composed a poem as a message of encouragement and had someone convey it to her verbally:\n\nConfidently live out your life\nand triumph over all,\nlaughing off\nthe devil of illness\nto become a queen of longevity.\n\nThe next day, I inscribed the poem on a decorative card and sent it to her.\n\nI sent another message to her the day before she was hospitalized: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Be confident. My wife and I are chanting for you. Put your mind at ease, and whatever you find out, don\u2019t let yourself be intimidated by illness. You mustn\u2019t let yourself be defeated. Again, there\u2019s nothing to worry about. Take care.\u201d\n\nI continued to send her messages the following day (the day she was hospitalized) and the day after that. She was undergoing several days of tests, so I wanted to give her as much encouragement as I could. I told her: \u201cStay cheerful. Remember, from the standpoint of the eternity of life, we are \u2018Buddhas in life\u2019 and \u2018Buddhas in death\u2019 (cf. WND-1, 456). It\u2019s a pity to make life a painful affair. Remain positive and upbeat, no matter what.\u201d\n\nI had a women\u2019s division member go in my stead to visit her at the hospital. She was apparently in high spirits, happy to have received my messages, and chanting with a firm determination to beat the devil of illness.\n\nTwo weeks later, the day before she was to receive the results of her tests, I sent her another message, this time asking someone to convey it by phone: \u201cHow are you doing? I am chanting in earnest for you, so everything will be fine. You will get better. This encounter with illness will deepen your prayers and become a source of strength as a personal experience in faith.\u201d\n\nThe test results showed that she had cancer\u2014a malignant lymphoma. She was also found to have a tumor about the size of a fist deep in her abdomen. Surgery was not possible, so she would have to undergo chemotherapy. This would involve one round of chemotherapy a month for 10 months. For the first two or three months she would have to remain in hospital, but after that, she could receive treatment as an outpatient.\n\nShe said that her doctors told her she would suffer severe side effects from the chemotherapy, including hair loss, lack of appetite, and nausea.\n\nBecause she hadn\u2019t yet experienced any symptoms of pain or discomfort, this discussion of her treatment drove home to her for the first time that she was dealing with something life-threatening.\n\nThe news of her illness was a great shock for her elderly parents and the rest of her family. They must have been distressed and worried beyond imagination.\n\nShe sent me a letter expressing her determination in which she wrote: \u201cBecause of your constant encouragement, I have been able to accept my diagnosis calmly. I will follow your advice to \u2018laugh off the devil of illness,\u2019 determined to fight on cheerfully and win.\u201d\n\nA person of firm resolve is strong. Resolute prayer strengthens our life force.\n\nEveryone in her hospital ward was suffering from similar illnesses. Some of them openly expressed their misery and said they would rather die than continue the harsh treatments. Observing their plight, she was well aware of the tough battle that lay ahead of her. It was only natural that one might feel anxious and afraid in such a situation. But she decided to face this challenge with unflinching courage.\n\nStrangely, she experienced no pain or discomfort after her first chemotherapy treatment. I was very happy to hear her first joyous report.\n\nHer hair soon began to fall out, but her second treatment also went well, and she was allowed to leave the hospital. Her appetite remained good, and she even gained weight. Not only that, the tumor in her stomach shrunk to one-third its original size.\n\nI received that report while I was on a visit to Russia. I immediately sent her a message congratulating her and telling her not to overexert herself.\n\nPraying for her to make a full recovery, my wife also wrote her a postcard saying: \u201cYou have achieved victory in the first stage. Please continue to be patient and take things slowly until you achieve complete victory. Remember, laugh off the devil of illness!\u201d\n\nAfter several more months of outpatient treatment, she completed her chemotherapy. The tumor in her stomach had almost completely disappeared.\n\nShe had to be careful over that nearly one-year period, because the chemotherapy had weakened her immune system. But aside from losing her hair, she experienced no painful side effects. She even returned to work. She was so cheerful throughout that no one would ever have imagined she was ill unless she told them. Her doctor, too, was genuinely surprised.\n\nI received a letter from her that was filled with joy and appreciation. I had been kept well informed of her progress, and I was very happy to hear of the successful outcome of her battle with illness. She wrote that she had constantly reminded herself of my advice to \u201claugh off the devil of illness,\u201d which she had found a great source of encouragement and strength.\n\nShe is now even more active than she was before her illness, and a growing number of people come to her for advice about dealing with health problems, because they know that she successfully overcame a serious illness.\n\nShe sincerely shares her experience with each of them and encourages them wholeheartedly. Nothing provides greater reassurance and hope than words of encouragement brimming with conviction based on personal experience.\n\nOvercoming illness is profoundly meaningful, not only in terms of one\u2019s own well-being, but also because it enables one to inspire and help many others who are going through similar struggles.\n\nAll sorts of things happen in life. It is a continuous series of changes. What matters in the end is never to be defeated by anything\u2014to keep fighting and not lose hope.\n\nLife is a struggle against our inner tendencies to give up when things are tough, to compromise and accept less. Please win in the struggle with yourself, vowing not to give up, not to be defeated.\n\nWe mustn\u2019t avoid difficulties. We must win out over our problems and sufferings. It is up to us to create our own treasures through our own efforts. \u201cI am happy. I have won!\u201d\u2014those who can create value in life so that they can say this with confidence are people who shine with true brilliance and character.\n\nFrom Haha no uta (Ode to Mothers), published in Japanese in August 1997.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.7]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.9]"}, {"title": "chapter-8-9.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.9]\n8.9 Four Mottoes for Good Health\nPresident Ikeda proposes four guidelines for good health based on the perspective of Buddhism and faith.\nI\u2019d like to speak to you a little about health.\n\nOnce, when I was talking with members of the Kansai Doctors Division and young women\u2019s division Nurses Group, I proposed four mottoes for leading a healthy life. They were just some simple personal thoughts I shared with the members, based on the perspective of Buddhism and faith. The doctors and nurses I was speaking with, however, agreed that my advice was also medically sound.\n\nThe four mottoes are:\n\nDo an invigorating gongyo\nLead a balanced and productive lifestyle\nContribute to the welfare of others\nEat wisely\nMedically speaking, such factors as diet, exercise, sleep, and stress relief are often mentioned as fundamental to good health, and all of those basic elements are included in the four mottoes I suggested.\n\n(1) Do an invigorating gongyo\n\nWhen our gongyo and chanting become sluggish or halfhearted, we feel physically sluggish, too. Many of you can probably relate to this.\n\nThe good fortune and benefit we derive through chanting vigorously are immeasurable. Our bodies, hearts, and minds begin to exhibit their limitless latent potential.\n\nAdditionally, sitting up straight and breathing deeply is also considered to be very beneficial for one\u2019s health from a medical viewpoint. Enhanced respiratory function improves our cardiovascular system.\n\nA member of the Doctors Division also commented that using our voices is an important way of relieving stress. Once people stop using their voices, they tend to age more quickly.\n\nSitting properly with our palms pressed together as we do gongyo and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is, in every sense, the most solemn and meaningful activity, in accord with the underlying principles governing the universe. Our individual bodies and minds, as the microcosm, are aligned and merged with the fundamental rhythm of the universe, the macrocosm. Day after day, our beings are rejuvenated. This is the first foundation for health and long life.\n\n(2) Lead a balanced and productive lifestyle\n\nSufficient sleep is another important foundation for good health. Not getting enough sleep is like leaving a car\u2019s engine constantly running. Eventually, it will malfunction or break down.\n\nMr. Toda used to say that the sleep we experience before midnight is twice as deep as the sleep after midnight, so we should go to bed as early as we can. This appears to be supported by medical science.\n\nManage your time wisely, and try to do your gongyo early and get to bed early. That will prepare you for a fresh start the next morning. Developing the wisdom and self-control to put this into practice will benefit your health.\n\nGetting stuck in an unhealthy cycle of staying up late, either out of routine or force of habit, and then oversleeping and waking up without ever feeling refreshed is definitely not putting faith into correct practice in daily life.\n\nRecently, there has been some focus on the benefits of \u201cmini naps\u201d\u2014brief naps of five or ten minutes\u2019 duration\u2014in promoting health and productivity. The key is to make good use of rest periods during the day so that you can take care of your health.\n\n(3) Contribute to the welfare of others\n\nPhysical activity is, of course, a crucial factor in improving health. And more particularly, activity in the form of our efforts to contribute to the promotion of Buddhism, the happiness of others, and the good of society are an incredible source of inner revitalization and energy for living vibrantly.\n\nIn contrast, if we stop taking action for others, regarding such efforts as a bother, and shut ourselves up in a shell of self-interest and uncaring individualism, then we will find our bodies and minds begin to stagnate, and often grow more susceptible to illness as a result.\n\nMovement is a defining characteristic of animals, including human beings. We need to move. If we aren\u2019t active, we are no different than objects of stone or wood. When living beings with the power of motion cease to be active, they begin to decline.\n\nThe same is true of water in a river. When the water stops flowing, it becomes cloudy and stagnant. In the realm of the Mystic Law, too, those who have stopped practicing because they found contributing to the welfare of others a chore are people who have allowed the clear water of their faith to become cloudy, causing them to spiritually stagnate.\n\nYou, on the other hand, are making noble efforts day and night to contribute to the welfare of others\u2014spreading the teachings of Nichiren Buddhism, encouraging your fellow members, and striving for the development of your communities.\n\nSometimes you may think: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to just stay home tonight and relax and watch TV?\u201d But in joyfully taking action for the happiness of others and your fellow members, you are leading lives infinitely more fulfilling and worthwhile.\n\nWe are said to live in a stressful society today. Our environment is filled with potential causes of stress.\n\nIn a certain respect, stress can be described as an attack on our spirits from outside. We need to fight back against it. If we remain still, we will be overwhelmed by its pressure, which will destroy us both physically and mentally.\n\nOne effective response to stress is to meet it by stepping forward and taking action. In that sense, our actions based on faith in the Gohonzon are actions for reviving and reinvigorating ourselves in perfect accord with the law of life.\n\nI have spoken many times of the importance of walking. It is said that a good way to get regular exercise is to walk ten thousand steps a day.\n\nSome say that aging starts when our legs begin to give out. Every step we take for our Soka Gakkai activities is hugely beneficial in terms of maintaining strength and promoting health.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cIf one lights a fire for others, one will brighten one\u2019s own way\u201d (WND-2, 1060).\n\nContributing to the welfare of others, imparting the light of hope to those around us, also brightens our own life with fresh hope and makes it shine with good fortune and benefit.\n\n(4) Eat wisely\n\nOvereating can lead to obesity. The Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai of China listed improper eating or drinking as a cause of illness (cf. WND-1, 631). How do we correct unbalanced eating habits? How do we effectively control the desire to eat more than we need to? This is where we need to apply wisdom and good sense.\n\nThe members of the Doctors Division and Nurses Group voiced specific concern about eating too much late at night, because some members tend to eat meals after attending nighttime Soka Gakkai activities.\n\nMedically speaking, it is desirable to stop eating three hours before going to bed. But if you\u2019re really hungry and find that impossible, then it\u2019s best to eat vegetables or some other low-calorie food.\n\nYou are all very important both for kosen-rufu and for your families. You mustn\u2019t put yourselves at risk by becoming too overweight, diabetic, or being afflicted by some other serious illness.\n\nEating wisely will help you lead pleasant, enjoyable lives. Take responsibility for looking after your own health.\n\nI hope that you will enjoy excellent physical and mental health and lead wonderful lives, adorning this noble existence with victory and happiness as you strive with vibrant faith and in joyful camaraderie.\n\nFrom a speech at a joint meeting for representatives of Kumamoto and Oita prefectures, Kumamoto, September 28, 1990.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.8]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.1]"}, {"title": "chapter-9-1.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.1]\n9.1 Enjoying a Rewarding and Fulfilling \u201cThird Stage of Life\u201d\nNone of us can avoid physical aging with the passage of time, but the members of the Soka family, practicing the Mystic Law, becoming more youthful and vibrant and accumulating more good fortune with each passing year, encourage one another and adorn their lives together with victory in human revolution.\n\nNichiren Daishonin encouraged a disciple with the words: \u201cYou will grow younger, and your good fortune will accumulate\u201d (WND-1, 464).\n\nLife is often divided into three periods\u2014the first stage of study, the second stage of independence and work, and the third stage of the fulfillment and completion of our lives. Here President Ikeda offers guidance on enriching that third period of life.\nBuddhism in general is focused on solving the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death. However, the essence of Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism lies not in simply overcoming these four sufferings. In The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, the Daishonin states: \u201cThe words \u2018four sides\u2019 [of the treasure tower] stand for birth, aging, sickness, and death. We use the aspects of birth, aging, sickness, and death to adorn the towers that are our bodies\u201d (OTT, 90). Nichiren Buddhism thus teaches a deeper understanding of those four sufferings, observing that they can be transformed into treasures that add dignity and splendor to \u201cthe towers that are our bodies,\u201d to the treasure tower of our lives themselves.\n\nThere is a saying: \u201cThe foolish regard old age as winter; the wise regard it as a golden time.\u201d Everything depends upon our attitude, how we approach life. Do we look at old age as a period of decline ending in death, or a period in which we have the opportunity to attain our goals and bring our life to a rewarding and satisfying completion? Is old age a descending path leading to oblivion, or an ascending path taking us to new heights? The same period of old age, especially in terms of the richness and fulfillment one can experience during those years, will be dramatically different depending upon one\u2019s outlook.\n\n*****\n\nLet\u2019s try to make the third stage of life a third stage of youth. Youth is not something that fades with age. Our attitude toward life is what makes us young. As long as we maintain a positive attitude and a spirit of challenge, we will continue to gain depth and richness and our lives will shine with the brilliance of gold or burnished silver.\n\nI think we can say that one of the most important challenges of the third stage of life is how to live in a way that is true to ourselves until the very last and show this to those around us.\n\nPeople\u2019s memories and recollections about a person who has passed away, the example of that individual\u2019s life, can be a great source of encouragement and strength to them.\n\nWhat can we contribute, what can we leave as a legacy for others in our third stage of life? After all is stripped away\u2014wealth, renown, social status\u2014the only thing that remains after one\u2019s death is the example of how one has lived one\u2019s life as a human being.\n\n*****\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cIf one lights a fire [lantern] for others, one will brighten one\u2019s own way\u201d (WND-2, 1060). In an aging society, this spirit of contributing to the welfare of others is very important. It ultimately means brightening our own way as well.\n\nNichiren Buddhism teaches that since we owe a debt of gratitude to all living beings, we should pray for all of them to attain Buddhahood (cf. WND-2, 637).\n\nValuing people; treasuring human relationships\u2014these are vital requirements for creating a society where people can truly enjoy long and fulfilling lives.\n\nWhat matters is how much we can improve the quality of our lives during our time here on Earth\u2014however long it may be. There is a difference between simply living a long life and living a rich and rewarding life. For example, a life can be fulfilled and productive even if it is short by time\u2019s measure.\n\nWhat matters is that we live each day without regret, moving forward in our work for kosen-rufu; that we continue to cherish in our hearts a shining purpose and reason for living, whatever our age. Living this way each day is the key to a life of profound satisfaction and fulfillment.\n\n*****\n\nThe memory of striving arduously in our Buddhist practice for both the happiness of ourselves and others and earnestly chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is eternal, enduring throughout the three existences of past, present, and future. It remains indelible in our lives, even if we should succumb to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It is clearly recorded in the \u201cdiary of the heart.\u201d\n\nSoka Gakkai activities are the greatest source of pride in life. When we chant and take action for the happiness of others, we, too, become happy. No way of life is more worthwhile.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cSingle-mindedly chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and urge others to do the same; that will remain as the only memory of your present life in this human world\u201d (WND-1, 64).\n\nWe have nothing to worry about. The good fortune and benefit we accumulate through our Buddhist practice will never age. Even should we suffer from Alzheimer\u2019s, they will remain latent in the depths of our beings.\n\nFundamentally, society must learn to value and respect the elderly, even those who suffer from Alzheimer\u2019s or other forms of cognitive decline, as venerable seniors, as predecessors who have made important contributions to society. With the rapid graying of society, all of us will be called upon to care for the elderly in one form or another.\n\nA graying society will have to revise its values, placing cooperation above competition, quality over efficiency, and spiritual richness over material richness. It will be a time when we ask not what others can do for us, but what we can do for others\u2014a time for seeking ways to make a contribution, while striving to stay fit and healthy. That is the life of creating value.\n\n*****\n\nThe Greek philosopher Plato is said to have advised: \u201cWe should recall in the vigor of the young people around us our former youthful vigor and allow their energy to revive us.\u201d\n\nAt Soka Gakkai discussion meetings, which are attended by people of all ages, the elderly have a chance to absorb the energy of the young, while the young have the opportunity to learn from the experience and wisdom of the elderly.\n\nNothing is wasted in Buddhism. In that sense, it is a model for an aging society.\n\nThe key is to keep hope alive in our lives, to hold on to our ideals. It is to press ahead with our mission as long as we are alive.\n\nThe American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote:\n\n\u201cFor age is opportunity no less\nThan youth itself, though in another dress,\nAnd as the evening twilight fades away\nThe sky is filled with stars, invisible by day.\u201d*1\n\nLet us join together in making the final years of our lives as brilliant as a night sky filled with sparkling stars.\n\n*****\n\nA life lived to the fullest to the very end is beautiful.\n\nThat\u2019s why it is crucial to maintain the spirit and lively activity of our youth throughout our lives. We mustn\u2019t use our age as an excuse to become inactive or withdraw from life.\n\nMany of Shakyamuni\u2019s senior disciples grew self-satisfied and complacent as they aged. They felt they had attained a certain status and degree of enlightenment, and that this was enough. They had practiced a long time; Shakyamuni\u2019s enlightenment was marvelous, they thought, but they would never match it, so they contented themselves with the state they had attained.\n\nShakyamuni, however, said this was mistaken. When he made his prophecy in the Lotus Sutra that Shariputra [who represents the persons of the two vehicles\u2014 voice-hearers and cause-awakened ones] would become a Buddha in future ages, he declared that his disciples must apply themselves vigorously to their Buddhist practice all their lives. He sternly urged them to keep striving, for this was the only way to attain Buddhahood. The senior disciples awakened to their own complacence, renewed their efforts, and were filled with joy. With this, persons of the two vehicles, who were said to be unable to attain Buddhahood, were able to become Buddhas as well (cf. LSOC3, 86\u201389).*2\n\n\u201cStrengthen your faith day by day and month after month\u201d (WND-1, 997)\u2014these words of the Daishonin epitomize the spirit of the Lotus Sutra and the Soka Gakkai.\n\n*****\n\nThe American poet Samuel Ullman wrote in his well-known poem \u201cYouth\u201d:\n\n\u201cYouth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind. . . .\n\n\u201cYouth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity of the appetite, for adventure over the love of ease. This often exists in a man of sixty more than a boy of twenty. . . .\u201d*3\n\nYouth is not a matter of chronological age. As long as one has a burning passion for kosen-rufu, one can still be a youth at 90.\n\nFaced with the inescapable realities of aging and death, how can people make their final chapter in life and in society a brilliant and active one, lived true to themselves? This will be the most important question for our rapidly graying society in the 21st century.\n\nNichiren Buddhism and the Soka Gakkai alone offer a genuine solution to this challenge. With that conviction, let us continue the grand journey of hope that is kosen-rufu, creating a triumphant history of lives lived to the fullest.\n\nFrom Daisan no jinsei o kataru (A Discussion on the Third Stage of Life\u2014Aging in Contemporary Society), published in Japanese in October 1998.\n\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, \u201cMorituri Salutamus,\u201d in The Poetical Works of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, vol. 3 (New York: AMS Press, Inc., 1966), p. 196.\n*2Attainment of Buddhahood by persons of the two vehicles: In the first half of the Lotus Sutra, persons of the two vehicles\u2014voice-hearers and cause-awakened ones\u2014receive a prophecy from Shakyamuni Buddha that they will attain Buddhahood in future ages. This prophecy refutes the view of the provisional Mahayana teachings, which deny persons of the two vehicles the attainment of Buddhahood, for they seek only personal salvation and do not strive to save others. The Lotus Sutra says that they will practice the bodhisattva way and attain Buddhahood.\n*3Margaret England Armbrester, Samuel Ullman and \u201cYouth\u201d: The Life, the Legacy (Tuscaloosa, Alabama: The University of Alabama Press, 1993), p. 113.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 8:\nFacing Illness [8.9]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.2]"}, {"title": "chapter-9-2.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.2]\n9.2 Striving to the End with a Spirit of Ceaseless Challenge\nExploring the profound Buddhist teaching of perpetual youth and eternal life, President Ikeda speaks of the golden value of old age.\nThe struggle against aging is really a struggle against the fear of facing new challenges. The aging process occurs more rapidly in those who start thinking that they\u2019ve done enough, who lose the spirit to foster younger people, and who remain attached to the past. Those who keep challenging themselves to the end are the most admirable and youthful of all. Such people are ever young and true victors of life. Come to think of it, the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was over 80 years old when he completed his masterpiece Faust.\n\nThe Soka Gakkai\u2019s founding president, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, continued advancing and challenging himself until the final moments of his life. He was 57 when he encountered Nichiren Buddhism and 59 when he founded the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai (Value-Creating Education Society; forerunner of the Soka Gakkai). In his 70s, he was still energetically traveling by train all the way to Kyushu to offer personal guidance and share Buddhism with others. He was fond of using the expression, \u201cWe youth.\u201d\n\nAbout a month before Mr. Makiguchi passed away, he wrote a postcard from his prison cell saying: \u201cI am avidly reading the philosophy of Kant.\u201d Such passionate seeking spirit and thirst for knowledge are no doubt the source of youthfulness.\n\nThe Buddhist teaching of perpetual youth and eternal life does not mean, of course, that we never age or die. It refers to our state of life, our life force. The Lotus Sutra states: \u201cIf a person who has an illness is able to hear this sutra, then his illness will be wiped out and he will know neither aging nor death\u201d (LSOC23, 330). And the Daishonin writes: \u201cIf we consider the power of the Lotus Sutra, we will find perpetual youth and eternal life before our eyes\u201d (WND-1, 413).\n\nIn other words, we are promised that, if we believe in and uphold the Mystic Law, we will never be defeated by illness, we can forever advance through life with a youthful spirit regardless of our age, and we can establish an eternal and indestructible state of happiness. This is nothing extraordinary. The precious members of the Many Treasures Group, who are always vibrantly active, are perfect examples of this.\n\nIn a certain respect, it\u2019s only natural that we dislike growing old, for it makes us think of the inevitable reality of death. But each period of life has its own distinct and precious value.\n\nWhat is the true significance of old age? It is not a time to look back with nostalgic longing on our youth. I believe it is the climax, the period of life that should be the most satisfying and fulfilling, the time when we shine with the brilliance and glory of a magnificent sunset. It\u2019s not a period of gloom and sadness. As the French writer Victor Hugo said: \u201cThere is an indefinable dawning in radiant old age.\u201d*1\n\nI feel that society today, unfortunately, has averted its gaze from the fundamental reality of death and, in the process, has lost sight of the golden value of old age.\n\nThe Daishonin encourages us to \u201cfirst of all learn about death, and then about other things\u201d (WND-2, 759). We must not avert our gaze from death but face it head-on and come to terms with it. If we can do that, we will come to appreciate old age in its own right and its true value will surely start to shine.\n\nFrom the Buddhist perspective of the eternity of life, death is just a departure into the next phase of life.\n\nThe Daishonin describes the Mystic Law as \u201cthe great lantern that illuminates the long night of the sufferings of birth and death\u201d (WND-1, 1038). Those who embrace the eternal Mystic Law are not afraid of death. They are not worried or troubled by it. They are able to freely savor the journey of life, experiencing a state of mind in which both life and death are a joy.\n\nNichiren Buddhism teaches the fundamental means for transforming a life bound by the four sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death into a joyous life characterized by the four virtues of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity.\n\nFrom Sho-ro-byo-shi to jinsei o kataru (Discussions on Life and Death), published in Japanese in November 2006.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Victor Hugo, Les Mis\u00e9rables, translated by Julie Rose (London: Random House, Inc., 2008), p. 1094.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.1]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.3]"}, {"title": "chapter-9-3.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.3]\n9.3 The Secret to a Vigorous Old Age\nIn this selection, President Ikeda discusses the best approach to enjoying a vigorous old age.\nWhat is the secret to longevity? Of course, individual differences must be taken into account, and there are many diverse opinions on this subject. But we of the Soka Gakkai would naturally agree that an important key to long life is our practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.\n\nOther than that, it is generally said that mental attitude has a vital influence on longevity. In that respect, I would like to share some attributes commonly listed as having a positive influence on longevity:\n\n(1) Not worrying about things too much.\n\nIn a Buddhist scripture, Shakyamuni states:\n\n\u201cThe past should not be followed after, the future not desired.\nWhat is past is got rid of and the future has not come.\nBut whoever has vision now here, now there, of a present thing,\nKnowing that it is immovable, unshakable, let him cultivate it.\nSwelter at the task this very day.\u201d*1\n\nIt is foolish to endlessly suffer and agonize over the past, or to needlessly fret and worry about the unknown future. Instead, we should concentrate on taking care of the things that we have to do today. What is important is that we live each day earnestly and conscientiously. This is the Buddha\u2019s message.\n\nThose who live long lives are for the most part optimists. I hope that you will live each day joyfully and with genuine optimism.\n\n(2) Having a goal or aim.\n\nFrench President Charles de Gaulle once remarked that the end of hope is the beginning of death.*2\n\nHope is life. To lose hope is to lose one\u2019s vital spirit.\n\nTo practice Nichiren Buddhism is to always live with hope. It means to take it upon oneself to create hope, actualize it, and continue to advance in ever higher spirits toward still greater hope. And faith is the driving force that enables us to do this.\n\n(3) Having a sense of humor and the ability to laugh.\n\nIn Europe, there is an old saying: \u201cA joyful heart is good medicine.\u201d\n\nThe German philosopher Immanuel Kant also noted that laughter has a positive effect on our health, functioning like a physician.*3\n\nTrue humor is not flippant; it is an expression of an open, relaxed, and generous heart.\n\nLet us live with \u201ca joyful heart.\u201d To do that, we must win in life each day, continuously pressing forward with powerful life force.\n\n(4) Striving in some work or mission.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize laureate Albert Schweitzer is reported to have said: \u201cI have no intention of dying so long as I can do things. And if I do things, there is no need to die. So, I will live a long, long time.\u201d*4 He in fact lived to the age of 90.\n\nWe can presume that the source of vitality that allowed him to live so long was the conviction that he had a mission to fulfill, and that as long as he did, he could not and would not die.\n\nIn addition to the four points I have listed, there may be other factors contributing to longevity. However, these four points are all contained in the teachings of Nichiren Buddhism and can be cultivated through our Soka Gakkai activities.\n\nThe members of the Soka Gakkai are advancing with hope, joyful hearts, and a sense of mission toward the great objective of kosen-rufu. All of you who make your way together with the Soka Gakkai are naturally leading the most admirable and fulfilling of lives.\n\nThe Daishonin assures Nichigen-nyo, the wife of Shijo Kingo: \u201cYou will grow younger, and your good fortune will accumulate\u201d (WND-1, 464).\n\nI hope that you will all deeply experience the immense power of the Mystic Law.\n\nFrom a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Tokyo, September 25, 1992.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Discourse on the Auspicious (Bhaddekarattasutta), in The Collection of the Middle Length Sayings (Majjhima-nikaya), translated by I.

As the population ages at an unprecedented rate in many countries, people are living longer than ever, and time spent in the so-called twilight years of life is increasing, posing numerous new challenges for individuals and society. We of the Soka family, especially our Many Treasures Group members, therefore, have an even greater mission to take up these issues and find new approaches and solutions.\n\nNo matter how much wealth or power one may possess, such things vanish like a fleeting dream in the face of the unrelenting reality of old age and death. What is crucial, then, is the philosophy one upholds and the life one has lived.\n\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, Nichiren Daishonin states: \u201cPassing through the round of births and deaths, one makes one\u2019s way on the land of the Dharma nature, or enlightenment, that is inherent within oneself\u201d (OTT, 52). The Mystic Law is the eternal and indestructible law governing all things in the universe. As people who chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo based on faith in the Mystic Law and are committed to realizing kosen-rufu, our lives, too, are eternal and indestructible, diamond-like and imperishable. I firmly believe that, as entities of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, our lives will continue advancing steadfastly and calmly \u201con the land of the Dharma nature, or enlightenment\u201d\u2014imbued with the four noble virtues of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity\u2014throughout the cycle of birth and death. As such, we have nothing to fear.\n\nIn one of his letters, Nichiren Daishonin warmly encourages and praises the lay nun Toki (the wife of Toki Jonin), who devotedly nursed her over-90-year-old mother-in-law until the latter passed away peacefully. This sincere disciple also faced her own health problems, which had perhaps been caused in part by exhaustion from caring for her mother-in-law. Nevertheless, she refused to be defeated by illness. Encouraging her, the Daishonin writes: \u201cThere is nothing to lament when we consider that we will surely become Buddhas\u201d (WND-1, 657).\n\nThere is no reason to lament and ask yourself why, after so many years of sincere and diligent practice of the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism, you should have to fall ill, or a family member should require nursing care, or some other such situation. Your practice has enabled you to lessen your karmic retribution*1 and makes it possible for you to change poison into medicine. When families practicing the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism pull together to overcome such obstacles based on faith, they will be able to open the way to attaining Buddhahood in a profound and substantial manner.\n\nBrimming with powerful conviction in faith and shining brightly as treasure towers, our Many Treasures Group members are making the final chapters of their lives truly joyful. Their examples are an unsurpassed source of hope and inspiration for the realization of a happy aging society where long life is genuinely celebrated.\n\nMy mentor, Josei Toda, declared: \u201cSmile amid the raging winds and fight on until your final day!\u201d\n\nMy wise friends of the Many Treasures Group, together let us always brim with hope and forge ever onward!\n\nFrom an editorial titled \u201cWise Members of the Many Treasures Group, Forge Ever Onward!\u201d published in Japanese in the Daibyakurenge, April 2014.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Lessening karmic retribution: This term, which literally means, \u201ctransforming the heavy and receiving it lightly,\u201d appears in the Nirvana Sutra. \u201cHeavy\u201d indicates negative karma accumulated over countless lifetimes in the past. As a benefit of protecting the correct teaching of Buddhism, we can experience relatively light karmic retribution in this lifetime, thereby expiating heavy karma that ordinarily would adversely affect us not only in this lifetime, but over many lifetimes to come.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.3]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.5]"}, {"title": "chapter-9-5.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.5]\n9.5 Building an \u201cEternal Palace\u201d in Our Lives\nPresident Ikeda teaches the importance of our final years as an opportunity to employ all our accumulated experience to promote the happiness of others as well as continue to advance our own efforts to attain true mastery of life.\nWhile residing at Mount Minobu, Nichiren Daishonin sent letters of encouragement to the elderly lay priest of Ko and his wife, the lay nun of Ko\u2014disciples who lived on faraway Sado Island.\n\nThe Daishonin concluded one of his letters to the couple, writing: \u201cNo place is secure. Be convinced that Buddhahood is the final abode\u201d (WND-1, 491). Where is our final abode, our sweet home, our safe haven? It is here. It is within us. The state of Buddhahood that we bring forth in our own lives is our eternal safe haven.\n\nExternal circumstances do not determine our peace of mind. No matter how wonderful a home we may live in, if we are sad and lonely, we cannot be said to be at ease or leading a happy life. Even if our present circumstances are good, there is no guarantee that they will continue that way forever. Only the \u201cpalace\u201d of peace and security that we build within our own life through our Buddhist practice is eternal.\n\nThe lay priest and lay nun of Ko practiced Buddhism alongside Abutsu-bo and his wife, the lay nun Sennichi, fellow residents of Sado Island. While warmly observing the two couples\u2019 friendship, the Daishonin offered them detailed encouragement so that they could work together in harmonious unity.\n\nThere is no doubt that the older one gets, the more one appreciates the good fortune of having supportive and encouraging friends. The members of the Soka Gakkai are extending a network of such treasured friendships throughout their communities and society at large.\n\nShakyamuni said: \u201cFor those who are always courteous and respectful of elders, four things increase: life, beauty, happiness, strength.\u201d*1 This certainly makes sense in terms of the law of cause and effect.\n\nA society that respects the elderly is one that respects human life; and such a society will continue to flourish and thrive.\n\nIn one of his writings, the Daishonin quotes the Lotus Sutra passage: \u201cWe may use our long lives to save living beings\u201d [LSOC17, 280] (GZ, 657).*2 \u201cLong life\u201d in this context refers to the immeasurably long life span of the Buddha as presented in the \u201cLife Span of the Thus Come One\u201d (16th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra. The eternal state of Buddhahood wells up within the lives of those who practice the Lotus Sutra.\n\nAlso, based on the Buddhist principle of \u201cprolonging our lives through faith,\u201d*3 we can strengthen our life force and extend our lives.\n\nMoreover, bodhisattvas do not strive to live long solely for their own sake. They do so to serve others to the greatest possible extent, using their experience and their seamless blend of compassion and wisdom to do so. This is a subtle but crucial distinction.\n\nIn one of his writings, the Daishonin refers to the leader of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth*4 as \u201ca venerable old man called Bodhisattva Superior Practices\u201d*5 (WND-1, 605). This passage has profound significance from the viewpoint of Buddhism, but what I want to note today is that the expression \u201cold man\u201d here is in no way negative or derogatory. It suggests a venerable majesty, bringing to mind a person possessing qualities indicating a true mastery of life\u2014for instance, firm and unwavering faith; unceasing compassionate action; indomitable courage; superb communication skills; unflagging patience; ineffable nobility and dignity; and a vast, inexhaustible reservoir of wisdom for solving any problem.\n\nWe could say that this perfectly describes the Bodhisattvas of the Earth, who are spreading the principles of humanism in the midst of these troubled times.\n\nFrom a speech at a nationwide representative leaders training course, Shizuoka, February 1, 1997.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1The Dhammapada: Sayings of the Buddha, translated by Thomas Cleary (New York: Bantam Books, 1995), p. 40.\n*2Cited in the writing \u201cShaka ichidai goji keizu\u201d (Outline of the Five Periods of the Shakyamuni\u2019s Lifetime Teachings); not translated in WND, vols. 1 or 2.\n*3Prolonging one\u2019s life through faith: This is based on the passage in the \u201cLife Span\u201d chapter of the Lotus Sutra that reads: \u201cWe beg you to cure us and let us live out our lives!\u201d (LSOC16, 269). This is in the section that explains the parable of the outstanding physician, who gives \u201cgood medicine\u201d to his children who have \u201cdrunk poison\u201d (that is, succumbed to delusion), and who implore him to cure their illness. Through taking this good medicine (that is, embracing faith in the wonderful Law of the Lotus Sutra), they are cured and able to enjoy many more years of life.\n*4Bodhisattvas of the Earth: An innumerable host of bodhisattvas who emerge from beneath the earth and to whom Shakyamuni Buddha entrusts the propagation of the Mystic Law, or the essence of the Lotus Sutra, in the Latter Day of the Law.\n*5When Shakyamuni declares in the \u201cEmerging from the Earth\u201d chapter of the Lotus Sutra that the vast multitudes of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth who have emerged are his original disciples, bodhisattva Maitreya expresses doubt, saying that it is as though a young man of 25 were to point to an old man of 100 and say: \u201cThis is my son!\u201d (LSOC15, 261).\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.4]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.6]"}, {"title": "chapter-9-6.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.6]\n9.6 There Is No Retirement from Faith\nSharing an observation by John Kenneth Galbraith about the importance of living each day to the fullest, no matter how old you are, President Ikeda states that the fundamental means for staying in good health is our daily gongyo, daimoku, and Soka Gakkai activities.\nDr. John Kenneth Galbraith, world-renowned economist and professor emeritus of Harvard University, is 90 years old and continues to work at a steady pace. Even now he is writing a new book. We have been friends for 20 years. I have visited him at his home in Boston [in 1993], and we met here in Tokyo [in 1978 and 1990]. He was kind enough to present a commentary when I delivered my second lecture at Harvard [\u201cMahayana Buddhism and Twenty-First-Century Civilization\u201d].\n\nSomething that Dr. Galbraith said during our meeting in Tokyo nine years ago made a very deep impression on me. \u201cI will be 82 the week after next [on October 15],\u201d he said, \u201cbut I regard each birthday as a fresh start. I believe the older we get, the more there is to learn.\u201d This is the philosophy of life of the ever-youthful Dr. Galbraith. He also offered the view that having firm goals or plans for the day when we get up in the morning is important in terms of staying alert and healthy.\n\nWe should wake up every morning ready to take on the world. In that regard, doing a vigorous morning gongyo and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, which enables us to start the day fresh and energetic, is a wonderful way to maintain health and well-being.\n\nOur practice of gongyo and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo represents a sublime ceremony in which we bring the microcosm of our lives into harmony with the fundamental rhythm of the macrocosm, the universe. We join our hands in prayer before the Gohonzon and do gongyo and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. Our voice reaches all Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and heavenly deities\u2014the protective functions of the universe. Though we cannot see them, they gather round us to keep us safe from harm. We are in their midst. How awesome is the power of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo! All of the protective functions become our allies. That is why we have the ability and mission to guide humanity to happiness.\n\nDr. Galbraith also remarked to me that the biggest mistake the elderly make is to retire from their work, for without having work to do, one ceases to exert physical and mental effort, adding that a decline in mental effort can have a particularly negative impact.\n\nThis applies all the more to the realm of faith: there is no retirement from faith. Our Soka Gakkai activities for kosen-rufu represent the greatest mental and spiritual effort. They strengthen our life force, and as such are a fundamental means for staying in good health.\n\nFrom a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Tokyo, July 3, 1999.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.5]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.7]"}, {"title": "chapter-9-7.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.7]\n9.7 Changing Our Attitude toward Aging\nPresident Ikeda talks about the Buddhist attitude toward aging with reference to Shakyamuni\u2019s teaching that to ignore the realities of aging, sickness, and death is a form of arrogance. An excerpt on this topic from his 2013 SGI Day Peace Proposal also appears at the end of this section.\nIn the Buddhist scriptures, Shakyamuni is said to have meditated on aging, sickness, and death and overcome three types of arrogance or pride.*1 In other words, aversion to the elderly is the arrogance of the young; aversion to the ill is the arrogance of the healthy, and aversion to the dead is the arrogance of the living.\n\nThese three types of arrogance indicated by Shakyamuni are by no means things of the past.\n\nIn discussing the problems of aging societies today, people often point to changes in society and inadequate institutions as their cause. Those are important factors, but I believe we must focus on the more essential issue of the arrogance in our hearts and work to transform human beings themselves.\n\nPeople have a strong tendency to scorn or despise whatever is different from themselves. During a lecture I gave at Harvard University [\u201cMahayana Buddhism and Twenty-First-Century Civilization,\u201d in September 1993], I referred to this as a prejudicial mind-set, an unreasoning emphasis on individual differences. Shakyamuni described it as a single, invisible arrow piercing the hearts of the people.\n\nBy clinging to this prejudicial mind-set, we are narrowing and diminishing ourselves through our own actions. We are limiting ourselves to our present state, refusing to change.\n\nAs long as people today try to ignore the realities of aging, sickness, and death, they are rejecting their own possibilities for the future.\n\nWe need to change our attitude toward aging. The enormous life experience the elderly possess is a precious treasure\u2014for the elderly themselves, for others around them, and for society and the world as a whole.\n\nIn one of his writings, Nichiren Daishonin notes that the long Chou dynasty of ancient China, spanning eight centuries, flourished because its founder King Wen took care of elderly people and respected their wisdom (cf. WND-1, 916).\n\nThe words of the elderly, rich with maturity, have an often startling degree of wisdom and substance. I know many elderly people who glow with great beauty.\n\nThose who have built an indestructible self through engaging in activities for kosen-rufu shine. Please live out your lives with self-confidence and courage.\n\nFrom Daisan no jinsei o kataru (A Discussion on the Third Stage of Life\u2014Aging in Contemporary Society), published in Japanese in October 1998.\nSupplementary Reading\n\nIn ancient India, Buddhism arose in response to the universal question of how to confront the realities of human suffering and engage with people ensnared in that suffering.\n\nThe founder of Buddhism, Gautama Buddha or Shakyamuni, was of royal birth, which guaranteed him a life of earthly comforts. Tradition has it that his determination as a young man to abandon those comforts and seek truth through monastic practice was inspired by the \u201cfour encounters\u201d with people afflicted by the pains of aging, sickness, and death.\n\nBut his purpose was never simply to reflect passively on life\u2019s evanescence and the inevitability of suffering. Later in life, he described his feelings at that time as follows: \u201cIn their foolishness, common mortals\u2014even though they themselves will age and cannot avoid aging\u2014when they see others aging and falling into decline, ponder it, are distressed by it, and feel shame and hate\u2014all without ever thinking of it as their own problem,\u201d*2 and he noted that the same holds true in our attitudes toward illness and death as well.\n\nShakyamuni\u2019s concern was always with the inner arrogance that allows us to objectify and isolate people confronting such sufferings as aging and illness. He was thus incapable of turning a blind eye to people suffering alone from illness or the aged cut off from the world.\n\nThere is an episode from his life that illustrates this.\n\nOne day, Shakyamuni encountered a monk who was stricken by illness. He asked him: \u201cWhy are you suffering, and why are you alone?\u201d The monk replied that he was lazy by nature and unable to endure the hardships associated with providing medical care to others. Thus, there was no one to tend to him. At which Shakyamuni responded: \u201cGood man, I will look after you.\u201d Shakyamuni took the stricken monk outdoors, changed his soiled bedding, washed him, and dressed him in new clothes. He then firmly encouraged him to always be diligent in his religious practice. The monk was immediately restored to a state of physical and mental well-being and joy.\n\nIn my view, it was not just Shakyamuni\u2019s unexpected and devoted care that affected the monk in this way. Rather, the fact that Shakyamuni encouraged him using the same strict yet warm language that he used with other disciples in good health revived the flame of dignity that was so close to being extinguished in this man\u2019s life.\n\nThis story as I have outlined it so far is based on an account in The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions.*3 However, when we compare this to the version transmitted in other sutras, a further aspect of Shakyamuni\u2019s motivation comes to light.\n\nAfter having tended to the sick monk, Shakyamuni is said to have gathered the other monks and asked them what they knew about his condition. As it turned out, they had been aware of his illness and the gravity of his condition, and yet none among them had made any effort to provide care.\n\nThe Buddha\u2019s disciples explained themselves in terms almost identical to those of the ailing monk: he had never attended to any of them in their time of illness.\n\nThis corresponds to the logic of personal responsibility as it is often used in contemporary settings to negate the need to care for others. For the ailing monk, this attitude fostered feelings of resignation, and for the other disciples it manifested itself as an arrogant justification of their disinterest. This logic atrophied his spirit and clouded theirs.\n\n\u201cWhoever would tend to me, should tend to the sick.\u201d With these words, Shakyamuni sought to dispel the delusions clouding the minds of his disciples and spur them to a correct understanding.\n\nIn other words, practicing the Buddha\u2019s way means to actively share the joys and sufferings of others\u2014never turning one\u2019s back on those who are troubled and in distress, being moved by others\u2019 experiences as if they were one\u2019s own. Through such efforts, not only do those directly afflicted by suffering regain their sense of dignity, but so too do those who empathetically embrace that suffering.\n\nThe inherent dignity of life does not manifest in isolation. Rather, it is through our active engagement with others that their unique and irreplaceable nature becomes evident. At the same time, the determination to protect that dignity against all incursions adorns and brings forth the luster of our own lives.\n\nBy asserting an essential equality between himself and an ailing monk, the Buddha sought to awaken people to the fact that the value of human life is undiminished by illness or age: he refused to acknowledge such distinctions and discriminations. In this sense, to regard the sufferings of others due to illness or age as evidence of defeat or failure in life is not only an error in judgment but undermines the dignity of all concerned.\n\nThe philosophical foundation of the SGI is the teachings of Nichiren, who emphasized the supremacy of the Lotus Sutra which, he stated, marks the epitome of Shakyamuni\u2019s enlightenment. In the Lotus Sutra, a massive jeweled tower arises from within the earth to symbolize the dignity and value of life. Nichiren compared the four sides of the treasure tower to the \u201cfour aspects\u201d of birth, aging, sickness and death (cf. OTT, 90), asserting that we can confront the stark realities of aging, illness, and even death in such a way that we remain undefeated by the suffering that accompanies them.

When I could no longer learn by nursing others, I would learn by being nursed, by seeing nurses practise upon me.\u201d*1 And she was true to those words all her life.\n\nAt around age 40, when she founded the Nightingale Training School for Nurses, she suffered another serious decline in health. She was constantly afflicted with headaches, nausea, and asthma attacks. Speaking for extended periods exhausted her. Many were worried that she might die too young, and she in fact did face several life-threatening health crises. Still, she never stopped her activities. She dismissed her illnesses, saying: \u201cI am so busy that I have no time to die.\u201d*2\n\nEven though she couldn\u2019t move about freely, she could write. For that reason, she always kept a supply of pens and pencils by her bedside. She produced an enormous number of articles and statistical documents, as well as more than 12,000 letters. Though her doctor advised her to stop writing, this only spurred her on: \u201cThey say I must not write letters. Whereupon I do it all the more.\u201d*3 She also declared: \u201cHad I lost the Report [i.e., not been able to complete it], what would the health I should have \u2018saved\u2019 have profited me?\u201d*4 These words illustrate the firm conviction that ran through her entire life. Nightingale was fueled by the bright flame of a powerful inner purpose to which she gave herself unstintingly.\n\nEventually, Nightingale\u2019s sight began to fail, yet she declared: \u201cNo, no, a thousand times no. I am not growing apathetic.\u201d*5 In her early 80s, she went blind. Nevertheless, she did not despair. She kept going with the spirit that she still had ears to hear and a mouth to speak. She astonished her visitors by how well informed she was of current events.\n\nThe Buddhist scriptures teach us that even if we lose our hands, we have our feet; even if we lose our feet, we have our eyes; even if we lose our eyes, we have our voice; even if we lose our voice, we have our life.*6 With that resolve, we must spread Buddhism as long as we live. This is the spirit of a true Buddhist.\n\nEven when Shakyamuni Buddha was on his deathbed, he preached the Law to an ascetic who had come to see him; he converted the man and welcomed him as his last disciple in his lifetime.*7\n\nMy mentor, Josei Toda, used to say that whether one\u2019s life was happy or unhappy is not decided until one\u2019s final years. The last years of Nightingale\u2019s life were the most beautiful and rich of all. She described her final years as the best days of her life. No woman was as loved and esteemed as she was at that time. It was said that just hearing her name cheered people up, and many women proclaimed that they wanted to be like her. People came from all over Britain and the world for her guidance and advice. Royalty and political leaders vied to meet her, but she refused to see anyone who did not have an interest in nursing.\n\nShe valued young people, saying: \u201cAll the more I am eager to see successors.\u201d*8 She received hundreds of letters from young girls who wanted to be nurses, and she answered most of them. To the very end, she sought out and challenged things that needed doing, planting the seeds of the future: \u201cTo make an art of Life! . . . That is the finest art of all the Fine Arts.\u201d*9 And that is precisely how Nightingale lived hers.\n\nOn August 13, 1910, that \u201cartful life\u201d came quietly to a close. She was 90 years old, and it was in the year marking the 50th anniversary of her school\u2019s founding. In accord with her wishes, her funeral was simple.\n\nNightingale viewed death as the beginning of a fresh round of \u201cimmense activity.\u201d*10 Nichiren Daishonin states: \u201cPassing through the round of births and deaths, one makes one\u2019s way on the land of the Dharma nature, or enlightenment, that is inherent within oneself\u201d (OTT, 52). Those who have faith in the Mystic Law advance with joy in both life and death on the great earth of their intrinsically enlightened nature\u2014in other words, the earth of Buddhahood.\n\nLife is eternal. That is why it is essential to forge an absolutely indestructible life state of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity in this existence. To do that, we need correct faith, and equally essential are sincere and just actions for the sake of others. Those who devote their lives to kosen-rufu can walk the path of eternal happiness savoring the highest of all joys.\n\nFrom an essay series On Florence Nightingale\u2014In Tribute to the Century of Women, published in Japanese in March 2002.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Lynn McDonald, Florence Nightingale: The Nightingale School (Ontario, Canada: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 2009), pp. 761\u201362.\n*2Zachary Cope, Florence Nightingale and The Doctors (Philadelphia: J.

What is a life of true value? What is death? What happens after death? Nichiren states, \u201cTherefore I should first of all learn about death, and then about other things\u201d (WND-2, 759). By confronting the issue of death head-on, we can build a truly happy life.\n\nThis chapter features President Ikeda\u2019s guidance on how to face and overcome the sufferings of birth and death.\nWhy do we practice Nichiren Buddhism? So that we may live the most wonderful lives. So that we may serenely overcome the four sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death that are an inescapable part of the human condition.\n\nThe first of the four sufferings is birth. Having been born, we must live out our lives. It is important that we strive to live on tenaciously to the very end, no matter what happens.\n\nOur Buddhist practice based on the Mystic Law gives us the powerful life force to live each day with strength and confidence, surmounting all kinds of problems and hardships. Why are we born? A life lived without meaning, without knowing the answer to that question, is shallow and empty. To just live, eat, and die without any real sense of purpose surely constitutes a base, animal-like existence.\n\nOn the other hand, to do, create, or contribute something that benefits others, society, and also ourselves, and to dedicate ourselves as long as we live to that challenge\u2014that is a life of true satisfaction, a life of value, a life of the loftiest humanity. Our Buddhist practice based on the Mystic Law, moreover, is the driving force that enables us to create the greatest possible value for ourselves and for others.\n\nAging is the second of the four sufferings. Life passes by in a flash. In the blink of an eye, we are old. Our physical strength wanes, and things start to go wrong with our bodies. Our practice of Nichiren Buddhism enables us to make our old age a time of great richness, like a golden autumn harvest, instead of a time of sad and lonely decline. The setting sun bathes the earth and sky in a magnificent glow. We practice Nichiren Buddhism so we can enjoy just such a vibrant, glowing old age, without regrets.\n\nThe third of the four sufferings is sickness. We are mortal beings. All of us experience illness in one form or another. The power of the Mystic Law enables us to bring forth the strength to overcome the suffering of sickness. Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cNam-myoho-renge-kyo is like the roar of a lion. What sickness can therefore be an obstacle?\u201d (WND-1, 412).\n\nThough we may fall ill or experience some other trying situation, if we are devoting ourselves to the realization of kosen-rufu, Nichiren Daishonin will protect us, as will all Buddhas and bodhisattvas and the heavenly deities\u2014the protective functions of the universe.\n\nThe Daishonin promises:\n\n\u201cA woman who takes this efficacious medicine [of Myoho-renge-kyo] will be surrounded and protected by these four great bodhisattvas [the leaders of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth*1] at all times. When she rises to her feet, so too will the bodhisattvas, and when she walks along the road, they will also do the same. She and they will be as inseparable as a body and its shadow, as fish and water, as a voice and its echo, or as the moon and its light.\u201d (WND-1, 415)\n\nAs this passage indicates, those who embrace faith in the Mystic Law will definitely be protected\u2014not only in this lifetime but throughout eternity.\n\nDeath is the last of the four sufferings. Death is uncompromising; we must all face it one day. When that moment comes, those who travel on the path of the Mystic Law will make their way serenely to the pure land of Eagle Peak aboard the \u201cgreat white ox cart\u201d*2 described in the Lotus Sutra. Their lives will merge with the world of Buddhahood of the universe. The Lotus Sutra describes the \u201cgreat white ox cart\u201d as being immense in every dimension and adorned with gold, silver, and countless precious gems.*3\n\nIf we attain the state of Buddhahood in this existence, that state will forever pervade our lives. In lifetime after lifetime, we will enjoy lives blessed with health, wealth, intellect, favorable circumstances, and good fortune. We will possess our own unique mission, and be born in a form suitable to fulfilling that mission. This state of life is everlasting; it can never be destroyed.\n\nIt is precisely so that you may enjoy such eternal happiness that I continually urge you to apply yourself to your Buddhist practice and firmly consolidate the state of Buddhahood in your life in this existence. This is not just a matter of personal sentiment. It is the teaching of Nichiren Daishonin.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial, therefore, that we do not move off the path leading to Buddhahood, but that we keep pressing ever forward with patience and persistence along the path of kosen-rufu and Buddhist practice.\n\nThere may well be times when we feel disinclined to do something, or when we would like to take a break. This is only natural, since we are ordinary beings. But what matters is that we stay on course, that we continue forging ahead patiently on the path to Buddhahood while encouraging one another along the way.\n\nIf a plane flies off course or a car veers carelessly off the road, it can easily have an accident or fail to reach its destination. Similarly, if our lives go off course, we, too, can crash, plunging into misfortune and misery. Though it may not be visible to the eye, there is a path or course in life. A path leading to absolute happiness exists without a doubt\u2014and that is the path of the Mystic Law.\n\nIf we continue on this path without abandoning our Buddhist practice, we will definitely come to savor a life of complete fulfillment, both materially and spiritually.\n\nFrom a speech at a gongyo meeting at New York Culture Center, U.S.A., June 15, 1996.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Bodhisattvas of the Earth: An innumerable host of bodhisattvas who emerge from beneath the earth and to whom Shakyamuni Buddha entrusts the propagation of the Mystic Law, or the essence of the Lotus Sutra, in the Latter Day of the Law.\n*2Great white ox cart: A carriage adorned with jewels and drawn by a great white ox. It appears in the parable of the three carts and the burning house in the \u201cSimile and Parable\u201d (3rd) chapter of the Lotus Sutra, where it represents the one Buddha vehicle, or the supreme vehicle of Buddhahood.\n*3In a portion of the speech not included in this excerpt, President Ikeda cited the passage from Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s writing \u201cOn the Large Carriages Drawn by White Oxen\u201d: \u201cThese large carriages drawn by white oxen [i.e., the great white ox carts] are able to fly at will through the sky of the essential nature of phenomena [Dharma nature, or enlightenment]. Those persons who come after me will ride in these carriages and journey to [the pure land of] Eagle Peak. And I, Nichiren, riding in the same kind of carriage, will come out to greet them\u201d (WND-2, 976).\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 9: Creating a Brilliant Final Chapter in Life [9.8]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.2]"}, {"title": "chapter-10-2.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.2]\n10.2 Death Gives Greater Meaning to Life\nInstead of trying to avoid facing the inevitability of death, properly understanding the crucial issue of life and death with a full awareness of death\u2019s weighty significance is an opportunity for elevating our lives.\nWe all know that we will die someday. But we cling to that idea of \u201csomeday,\u201d expecting it to be far off in the future. Young people naturally try to brush aside the thought of death, but this is even true of older people, and perhaps increasingly so as we age.\n\nBut the reality of life is that it may come to an end at any moment. The possibility of death is always with us\u2014be it from an earthquake, an accident, or a sudden illness. We simply choose to forget this.\n\nAs someone once noted: \u201cDeath does not lie in wait before us; it creeps up on us from behind.\u201d\n\nAs we keep procrastinating, telling ourselves, \u201cI\u2019ll challenge myself harder someday,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll make greater efforts after I finish doing this,\u201d our lives slip by and, before we know it, we are facing death without having achieved anything, without having accumulated any really profound inner treasures of life. Many people live their lives this way. When the final moment comes, it\u2019s too late for regrets.\n\nUpon reflection, whether death awaits in three days, three years, or three decades, the reality is essentially the same. That\u2019s why it is so important to live fully right now, so that we will have no regret if we die at any moment.\n\nFrom the perspective of eternity, even a century is just an instant. It is genuinely true, as the Daishonin says, that \u201cnow is the last moment of one\u2019s life\u201d (WND-1, 216). Furthermore, second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda said: \u201cIn truth, we practice Buddhism for the time of our death.\u201d\n\nNothing is more certain than death. That\u2019s why it is vital to immediately set ourselves to the task of accumulating the treasures of the heart that will endure for eternity. Yet the great majority of people put off this most crucial of all tasks or leave it for some future time.\n\nThere is nothing as important as what Buddhism calls the \u201cone great matter of life and death.\u201d Compared to this crucial matter, everything else is minor\u2014a fact that becomes abundantly clear at the moment of death.\n\nSomeone who has been at the bedside of many at their last moments has said: \u201cIn their final days, it seems that people often recall their lives as if gazing over a vast panorama. What appears to stand out are not things such as having led a company or done well in business, but rather how they have lived their lives, who they have loved, who they\u2019ve been kind to, who they\u2019ve hurt. All of their deepest emotions\u2014the feeling of having been true to their beliefs and lived a fulfilled life, or painful regrets at having betrayed others\u2014rush upon them as they approach death.\u201d\n\nAn awareness of death gives greater meaning to our lives. Awakening to death\u2019s reality prompts us to seek the eternal and motivates us to make the most of each moment.\n\nWhat if there were no death? Life would just go on and on and probably become painfully dull.\n\nDeath makes us treasure the present. Modern civilization is said to ignore or deny death. It is no coincidence that it is also a civilization characterized by the unfettered pursuit of desires. A society or civilization, just like an individual, that tries to avoid the fundamental question of life and death, will fall into spiritual decline as it fails to look beyond living for the moment.\n\nFrom The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra, vol. 4, published in Japanese in December 1998.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.1]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.3]"}, {"title": "chapter-10-3.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.3]\n10.3 The Buddhist View of Life That Transcends the Suffering of Death\nWhile confronting the fundamental suffering of death, Shakyamuni established a view of eternal life. Through a consideration of Shakyamuni\u2019s enlightenment, President Ikeda explores the essence of the Buddhist conception of life and death.\nAll living things have an instinctual fear of death. Human beings in particular are afflicted by an indescribable terror when they contemplate what sort of world may await them after departing from the realm of the living.\n\nWith tremendous courage, Shakyamuni overcame this primal human instinct to fear death, to refuse to countenance or contemplate its reality, and accepted the suffering that is the true nature of human existence. Then, based on that courageous stance, he deeply pondered the essence of life and death.\n\nBuddhism teaches the eternity of life, but not as a simplistic response to people\u2019s cherished hopes for immortality. The Buddhist teachings of the impermanence of all phenomena and the four noble truths (clarifying the causes and the resolution of human suffering)*1 directly expose the reality of the suffering inherent in life, a reality that people try to avoid. Shakyamuni did not seek to whitewash the reality of existence by offering some consoling myth or fiction; he looked at it directly, with cool objectivity. All things that are born will die. He affirmed this as the underlying truth of existence.\n\nWhy do we die? Are life and death completely separate from one another? Or are they closely interrelated? Is there a continuity underlying life itself? Reflecting on his own life, Shakyamuni sought the answers to those questions with courage, tenacity, and objectivity. And the truth to which he became enlightened is that life is eternal.\n\nHuman existence includes both life and death. It flows on eternally, with a powerful force, repeating a cycle of alternating manifest and latent phases. Shakyamuni saw this in the flow of his own life.\n\nHis is not a philosophy of the immortality of the soul, arising from a dogged attachment to life, but a solid affirmation of the eternity of life based on a recognition of the law of cause and effect unfolding within each individual life.\n\nThe significance of death in such a view of life\u2019s eternity is that death exists for the sake of life. It is akin to sleep, which provides us with the rest we need to awaken once again. Death is an \u201cexpedient means\u201d for life. Death\u2019s purpose is to make life shine brighter, while life is the innate activity of existence. Life and death are not in opposition to one another; death exists for the sake of life. This is the meaning of the Lotus Sutra teaching of \u201centering nirvana as an expedient means\u201d (cf. LSOC16, 271).*2\n\nThe essential message of Buddhism is not pessimistic or negative; nor is it unfounded optimism. Buddhism looks directly at the suffering of life and offers a philosophy for living with joy by actively engaging with reality rather than trying to escape from it. There is no true joy to be had in fleeing from suffering. An indestructible, everlasting, and inexhaustible joy is only achieved by accurately seeing the true reality of the suffering we would like to escape and courageously rising to its challenge and overcoming it.\n\nFrom Seimei o kataru (Dialogue on Life), vol. 3, published in Japanese in March 1974.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1 Four noble truths: A fundamental doctrine of Buddhism clarifying the cause of suffering and the way of emancipation. The four noble truths are the truth of suffering, the truth of the origin of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path to the cessation of suffering. Shakyamuni is said to have expounded the four noble truths at Deer Park in Varanasi, India, during his first sermon after attaining enlightenment. They are: (1) all existence is suffering; (2) suffering is caused by selfish craving; (3) the eradication of selfish craving brings about the cessation of suffering and enables one to attain nirvana; and (4) there is a path by which this eradication can be achieved, namely, the discipline of the eightfold path. The eightfold path consists of right views, right thinking, right speech, right action, right way of life, right endeavor, right mindfulness, and right meditation.\n*2 In the Lotus Sutra, Shakyamuni declares that his life as a Buddha is eternal, but as a means to help living beings arouse a seeking spirit, he appears to enter nirvana, or extinction.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.2]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.4]"}, {"title": "chapter-10-4.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.4]\n10.4 The Oneness of Life and Death\nBased on the teachings of the Lotus Sutra, President Ikeda elucidates the eternity of life, that birth and death continue in an endless cycle of latent and active states.\nBirth and death are different aspects of life. In other words, life manifests solely through the cycle of birth and death.\n\nIn the eyes of ordinary mortals, life begins with birth and ends with death. But the insight of Buddhism sees through this limitation and perceives the essence of life as a whole, manifesting actively as birth or existence and persisting in dormant form as death. From that perspective, how does Buddhism view these two aspects of birth and death?\n\nThe \u201cLife Span\u201d chapter of the Lotus Sutra speaks of \u201cebbing\u201d and \u201cflowing\u201d (cf. LSOC16, 267). \u201cEbbing\u201d refers to death and \u201cflowing\u201d to life. Based on the standpoint of the eternity of life, the \u201cLife Span\u201d chapter states that life itself does not disappear and emerge, does not undergo birth or death. In The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, Nichiren Daishonin reveals an even more profound view of life as the \u201coriginally inherent nature of birth and death\u201d (OTT, 127).*1\n\nAccording to this principle, living is the state in which our life is actively manifested, and death is the state when it returns to a latent or potential state. These phases of birth and death continue eternally. That is the true nature of life itself.\n\nThe supreme teaching of Buddhism that views living as an active state and death as a latent state offers a profound and magnificent view of the eternity of life.\n\nIn addition, it teaches the oneness of life and death. Life is activated by a wondrous, underlying power. When life in its latent state comes into contact with the right causes and conditions, it becomes manifest and takes shape as a dynamic living being with a rich individuality. Eventually, that life quietly ebbs and moves toward death. But as it shifts into its potential, dormant phase, it stores a new energy, awaiting the next new phase of life.\n\nLife is an explosion and burning of the stored-up energy that had been in a resting state. Eventually that life brings its story to a close and it drifts back into death. It merges with the universe, is recharged by the power of the life of the universe as a whole, and awaits its next emergence into active life.\n\nThis is the nature of life and death inherent in all things, and Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the foundation of this intrinsic rhythm of the universe.\n\nFrom a lecture on Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s writing \u201cThe Heritage of the Ultimate Law of Life,\u201d published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, April 1977.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1 In The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, Nichiren Daishonin says: \u201cWe may also say that nonexistence (mu) and existence (u), birth and death, ebbing and flowing, existing in this world and entering extinction, are all, every one of them, actions of the eternally abiding inherent nature\u201d (OTT, 127\u201328).\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.3]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.5]"}, {"title": "chapter-10-5.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.5]\n10.5 Savoring Joy in Both Life and Death\nReferring to his observations on the Buddhist view of life and death presented in \u201cMahayana Buddhism and Twenty-First-Century Civilization,\u201d the lecture he delivered at Harvard University in 1993, President Ikeda asserts that those who dedicate their lives to kosen-rufu and build a state of absolute happiness can advance along a path in which there is joy in both life and death. Excerpts from the lecture also appear at the end of this section.\nI have been invited to speak at Harvard University, one of the most prestigious institutions of higher learning in the United States, on two occasions (in 1991 and 1993). In my second speech, I addressed the Buddhist view of life and death, in which we can experience joy in both life and death.\n\nDr. Harvey Cox, then chair of the Harvard Divinity School\u2019s Department of Applied Theology, commented that I had presented my audience with a completely new perspective on death.\n\nDeath is not the end of everything. Birth and death are both aspects of the eternity of life. The cycle of birth and death grounded in the Mystic Law is a drama unfolding on a great stage of life existing eternally. By striving for kosen-rufu, we can firmly establish a state of absolute happiness in this existence. People who achieve that can advance along the path of joy in both life and death.\n\nThis planet Earth is not the only place one can be born. In this vast universe, many scientists believe, there are innumerable planets where life exists. The Lotus Sutra presents a grand and expansive view of the universe, teaching that the number of realms in which living beings reside is infinite\u2014a view that is widely supported by contemporary astronomy. There may be some planets where all the inhabitants are good and virtuous, and others, like our Earth, where there are also many who are selfish and devious. There may also be planets where everyone lives happily, in fine health, enjoying long lives, and listening to beautiful music from morning to night.\n\nWhen the functions of our hearts and minds and the functions of the universe are in synch, we can be born wherever we wish and in any form we desire. The Lotus Sutra speaks of \u201cfreely choosing where one will be born\u201d (cf. LSOC10, 202). This is the essence of Buddhism.\n\nPresident Toda often likened death to sleep. Just as we awake refreshed and energized after a good night\u2019s sleep, those who pass away having chanted Nam-myoho-renge-kyo throughout their lives will, after a period of rest, be reborn to once again join the ranks of those striving for kosen-rufu, he used to say.\n\nNichiren Daishonin repeatedly offers guidance about the moment of death in his writings. For example:\n\n\u201cHow can we possibly hold back our tears at the inexpressible joy of knowing that [at the moment of death] not just one or two, not just one hundred or two hundred, but as many as a thousand Buddhas will come to greet us with open arms!\u201d (WND-1, 216\u201317)\n\n*****\n\n\u201cWithout fail, I will be with you at the time of your death and guide you from this life to the next.\u201d (WND-1, 965)\n\n*****\n\n\u201cWhen he was alive, he was a Buddha in life, and now he is a Buddha in death. He is a Buddha in both life and death. This is what is meant by that most important doctrine called attaining Buddhahood in one\u2019s present form.\u201d (WND-1, 456)\n\n*****\n\nA belief in the eternity of life has been shared by many of the world\u2019s great writers and thinkers. Their view of life has much in common with the perspective of Buddhism.\n\nLeo Tolstoy was one such individual. In 1907, when he was 79 years old, a few years before he passed away, Tolstoy wrote: \u201cLiving is joyous, and death, too, is joyous.\u201d*1 These words express the unshakable state of mind that Tolstoy had reached after a life of great vicissitudes.\n\nThe eminent British historian Arnold J. Toynbee was also deeply impressed by the Buddhist view of life.\n\nWe have faith in, are practicing, and are sharing the supreme teaching of Buddhism, eagerly sought by the world\u2019s leading thinkers. There is no life more wonderful.\n\nFrom a speech at a joint training session, Nagano, August 19, 2005.\nSupplementary Reading\n\nIt was the Greek philosopher Heraclitus who declared that all things are in a state of flux and that change is the essential nature of reality. Indeed, everything, whether it lies in the realm of natural phenomena or of human affairs, changes continuously. Nothing maintains exactly the same state for even the briefest instant; the most solid-seeming rocks and minerals are subject to the erosive effects of time. But during this century of war and revolution, normal change and flux seem to have been accelerated and magnified. We have seen the most extraordinary panorama of social transformations.\n\nThe Buddhist term for the ephemeral aspect of reality is \u201cthe transience of all phenomena\u201d (shogyo mujo in Japanese). In the Buddhist cosmology, this concept is described as the repeated cycles of formation, continuance, decline, and disintegration through which all systems must pass.\n\nDuring our lives as human beings, we experience transience as the four sufferings: the suffering of birth (and of day-to-day existence), that of illness, of aging, and finally, of death. No human being is exempt from these sources of pain. It was, in fact, human distress, in particular the problem of death, that spawned the formation of religious and philosophical systems.\n\nIt is said that Shakyamuni was inspired to seek the truth by his accidental encounters with many sorrows at the gates of the palace in which he was raised. Plato stated that true philosophers are always engaged in the practice of dying, while Nichiren, founder of the school of Buddhism followed by members of the SGI, admonishes us to \u201cfirst of all learn about death, and then about other things\u201d (WND-2, 759).\n\nDeath weighs heavily on the human heart as an inescapable reminder of the finite nature of our existence. However seemingly limitless the wealth or power we might attain, the reality of our eventual demise cannot be avoided. From ancient times, humanity has sought to conquer the fear and apprehension surrounding death by finding ways to partake of the eternal. Through this quest, people have learned to overcome control by instinctual modes of survival and have developed the characteristics that we recognize as uniquely human. In that perspective, we can see why the history of religion coincides with the history of humankind.\n\nModern civilization has attempted to ignore death. We have diverted our gaze from this most fundamental of concerns as we try to drive death into the shadows. For many people living today, death is the mere absence of life; it is blankness; it is the void. Life is identified with all that is good: with being, rationality, and light. In contrast, death is perceived as evil, as nothingness, and as the dark and irrational. Only the negative perception of death prevails.\n\nWe cannot, however, ignore death, and the attempt to do so has exacted a heavy price. The horrific and ironic climax of modern civilization has been in our time what Zbigniew Brzezinski has called the \u201ccentury of megadeath.\u201d Today, a wide range of issues is now forcing a reexamination and reevaluation of the significance of death. They include questions about brain death and death with dignity, the function of hospices, alternative funerary styles and rites, and research into death and dying by writers such as Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross.\n\nWe finally seem to be ready to recognize the fundamental error in our view of life and death. We are beginning to understand that death is more than the absence of life; that death, together with active life, is necessary for the formation of a larger, more essential, whole. This greater whole reflects the deeper continuity of life and death that we experience as individuals and express as culture. A central challenge for the coming century will be to establish a culture based on an understanding of the relationship of life and death and of life\u2019s essential eternity. Such an attitude does not disown death, but directly confronts and correctly positions it within the larger context of life.\n\nBuddhism speaks of an intrinsic nature (hossho in Japanese, sometimes translated as \u201cDharma nature\u201d) existing within the depths of phenomenal reality. This nature depends upon and responds to environmental conditions, and it alternates between states of emergence and latency. All phenomena, including life and death, can be seen as elements within the cycle of emergence and latency, or manifestation and withdrawal.\n\nCycles of life and death can be likened to the alternating periods of sleep and wakefulness. Just as sleep prepares us for the next day\u2019s activity, death can be seen as a state in which we rest and replenish ourselves for new life. In this light, death should be acknowledged, along with life, as a blessing to be appreciated. The Lotus Sutra, the core of Mahayana Buddhism, states that the purpose of existence, the eternal cycles of life and death, is for living beings to \u201cenjoy themselves at ease\u201d (LSOC16, 272). It further teaches that sustained faith and practice enable us to know a deep and abiding joy in death as well as in life, to equally \u201cenjoy ourselves at ease\u201d in both. Nichiren describes the attainment of this state as the \u201cgreatest of all joys\u201d (OTT, 212).\n\nIf the tragedies of this century of war and revolution have taught us anything, it is the folly of believing that reform of external factors, such as social systems, is the linchpin to achieving happiness. I am convinced that in the coming century, the greatest emphasis must be placed on fostering inwardly-directed change. In addition, our efforts must be inspired by a new understanding of life and death.\n\nFrom a lecture at Harvard University, \u201cMahayana Buddhism and Twenty-First-Century Civilization,\u201d U.S.A., September 24, 1993.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1 Translated from Japanese. Leo Tolstoy, Torusutoi zenshu (Collected Works of Tolstoy), vol. 21 (Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1931), p. 408.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.4]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.6]"}, {"title": "chapter-10-6.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.6]\n10.6 Advancing on the Path of Buddhahood in Both Life and Death\nThe aim of Buddhism is to establish a state of indestructible happiness enduring throughout past, present, and future, making it crucial that we strengthen our inner life state of Buddhahood in this lifetime.\nBuddhism began from the quest to find a solution to the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death. Life and death are the most important questions of existence, yet many people turn away from looking at them.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cThe Nirvana Sutra states, \u2018Human life runs its course more swiftly than a mountain stream; the person here today will not likely be here tomorrow.\u2019 The Maya Sutra reads, \u2018Imagine, for instance, a flock of sheep being driven by a chandala*1 to the slaughterhouse. Human life is exactly the same; step by step one approaches the place of death.\u2019 The Lotus Sutra states, \u2018There is no safety in the threefold world*2; it is like a burning house, replete with a multitude of sufferings, truly to be feared.\u2019 [LSOC3, 105]\n\n\u201cIn these passages from the sutras, our compassionate father, the World-Honored One of Great Enlightenment [Shakyamuni Buddha], admonishes us, the ordinary people of the latter age; it is his warning to us, his ignorant children. Nevertheless, the people do not awaken for even one instant; nor do they conceive a desire to attain the way for even a single moment. In order to decorate their bodies, which, if abandoned in the fields, would be stripped naked overnight, they spend their time striving to pile up articles of clothing.\n\n\u201cWhen their lives come to an end, within three days their bodies will turn into water that washes away, into dust that mixes with the earth, and into smoke that rises up into the sky, leaving no trace behind. Nevertheless, they seek to nurture these bodies and to amass great wealth.\u201d (WND-1, 891)\n\nThe Daishonin\u2019s description of human foolishness in forgetting the inevitability of death and seeking for meaningless things is just as true today as it was then\u2014perhaps even more so. No matter how we may appear to flourish, as long as we sidestep the fundamental issue of life and death, we remain as rootless as floating weeds or like a castle built on sand.\n\nLife is indeed impermanent\u2014but simply being aware of its impermanence is no solution. Despairing over this reality also serves no purpose. The question is how we can create eternal value in this fleeting existence. The Lotus Sutra holds the answer.\n\nNichiren Daishonin describes the lives of practitioners of the Lotus Sutra very simply as follows: \u201cPassing through the round of births and deaths, one makes one\u2019s way on the land of the Dharma nature, or enlightenment, that is inherent within oneself\u201d (OTT, 52).\n\nIn other words, those who practice the Lotus Sutra advance serenely and steadily in both life and death on the boundless land of the Dharma nature, the firm ground of Buddhahood. They press onward in the supreme and magnificent \u201cgreat white ox cart.\u201d*3\n\nThe ground of Buddhahood is a state of indestructible happiness. It is the life state of one\u2019s own attainment of Buddhahood, as firm and solid as the earth itself. When that life state is established, it continues throughout the three existences of past, present, and future. That\u2019s why we must make our best effort in this present existence.\n\nWe advance with joy in both life and death on the earth of the Dharma nature. This means that we make our way through repeated cycles of birth and death. We advance upon the earth of our own lives, not the earth of others. That means that happiness is something we build ourselves. It is not something given to us by others. For, ultimately, things given to us by others do not last.\n\nYou may depend on your parents, but the day will come when they are no longer there. You may depend on your spouse or partner, but they may die before you. In addition, we never know what changing times will bring. For example, World War II, and the times preceding and following it, were filled with countless tragedies.\n\nThe foundation for true happiness is built through one\u2019s own efforts, one\u2019s own wisdom, one\u2019s own good fortune. The purpose of our Buddhist practice is to solidify that foundation, while our Soka Gakkai activities serve to strengthen and empower us. This is the meaning of the Daishonin\u2019s words, \u201cone makes one\u2019s way on the land of the Dharma nature\u201d (OTT, 52).\n\nThe Daishonin also says that wherever we may frolic or play, no harm will come to us; we will move about without fear like the lion king (cf. WND-1, 412).\n\nWe will enjoy such a state eternally\u2014that is the aim of our Buddhist faith and practice.\n\nWe advance eternally on our own \u201cland.\u201d When we die, we do not go either to heaven or to the depths of hell. We remain on the same land or foundation and continue to enact our drama of mission through the cycle of birth and death. We press forward along the golden path of kosen-rufu for all time.\n\nThe Daishonin urges us to keep forging ahead on the firm ground of our Buddhahood, experiencing joy in both life and death, and to continue solidifying that all-important foundation. Such is the profound view of life and death taught in Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nFrom a speech at a nationwide representatives conference, Tokyo, March 29, 1996.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1 Chandala: A class of untouchables, below the lowest of the four castes in the ancient Indian caste system. People in this class handled corpses, butchered animals, and carried out other tasks associated with death or the killing of living things. Nichiren declared himself to be a member of the chandala class because he was born to a fisherman\u2019s family.\n*2 Threefold world: The world of unenlightened beings who transmigrate within the six paths (from hell through the realm of heavenly beings). The threefold world consists of, in ascending order, the world of desire, the world of form, and the world of formlessness. In a general sense, it refers to the saha world in which we dwell.\n*3Great white ox cart: A carriage adorned with jewels and drawn by a great white ox. It appears in the parable of the three carts and the burning house in the \u201cSimile and Parable\u201d (3rd) chapter of the Lotus Sutra, where it represents the one Buddha vehicle, or the supreme vehicle of Buddhahood.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.5]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.7]"}, {"title": "chapter-10-7.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.7]\n10.7 The Death of Someone Close to Us\nReferring to Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s encouragement of his disciple Nanjo Tokimitsu and his mother, President Ikeda offers the wisdom we need to accept the suffering of separation from those we love.\nHow can we overcome the inherent human sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death? The wisdom of Buddhism provides a sound and illuminating answer to this question.\n\nNo one can avoid the suffering of having to part from loved ones. Buddhism offers clear insights on this point.\n\nNanjo Hyoe Shichiro, Nanjo Tokimitsu\u2019s father, died of illness while still quite young. Tokimitsu was only seven at the time. By embracing the Daishonin\u2019s teachings, unafraid of the persecution this would invite, Hyoe Shichiro had opened the way for transforming the karma of his entire family.\n\nIn a letter of encouragement to the lay nun Ueno, Tokimitsu\u2019s mother, the Daishonin writes: \u201cWhen he [your deceased husband] was alive, he was a Buddha in life, and now he is a Buddha in death. He is a Buddha in both life and death\u201d (WND-1, 456).\n\nLife is eternal. Those who dedicate their lives to the Mystic Law are Buddhas in both life and death. Therefore, they will without fail move ahead serenely and confidently in a boundless state of being in which both life and death are filled with joy.\n\nCarrying on her late husband\u2019s spirit, the lay nun Ueno maintained strong faith. She raised Tokimitsu and her other children to become outstanding successors who followed in their father\u2019s footsteps as sincere practitioners of the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism.\n\nIt appears that Tokimitsu must have regretted losing his father at such a young age and thus missing out on receiving instruction and guidance from him.*1 Keenly aware of Tokimitsu\u2019s feelings in this regard, the Daishonin encourages and assures him:\n\n\u201cPersons who uphold this sutra [the Lotus Sutra], though they may be strangers to one another, will meet on Eagle Peak.*2 And how much more certain is it that you and your late father, because you both have faith in the Lotus Sutra [Nam-myoho-renge-kyo], will be reborn there together!\u201d (WND-2, 500)\n\nTies based on the Mystic Law are eternal. A family whose members dedicate their lives to the Mystic Law can be born together again in the same place\u2014such is the wondrous power of the Mystic Law.\n\nAmong the Daishonin\u2019s followers was a couple who had been moved to embrace his teachings because of the death of their beloved son, the experience contributing to deepening their faith. This husband and wife earnestly practiced the Mystic Law and sincerely supported the Daishonin. In praise of their faith, the Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cThis [the sincerity of your faith] is no ordinary matter. Indeed, Shakyamuni Buddha himself may have taken possession of your body. Or perhaps your deceased son has become a Buddha and, in order to guide his father and mother, has taken possession of your hearts. . . .\n\n\u201cIf anything should happen to you, just as the moon emerges to shine in the dark night, so the five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo*3 will appear as a moon for you. Be convinced that Shakyamuni Buddha, the Buddhas of the ten directions, and the son who preceded you in death will appear in this moon.\u201d (WND-1, 1049\u201350)\n\nLives connected by the Mystic Law are always together, transcending the bounds of life and death, encouraging, protecting, and guiding one another as they advance on a course of absolute happiness and victory.\n\nThere is no sorrow or gloom in the realm of the Mystic Law. Family members who practice the Mystic Law will always be enveloped in the moonlight of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity\u2014the four noble virtues of Buddhahood. Their lives will impart immeasurable hope and courage to those who follow in their footsteps.\n\nFrom a speech at a Tokyo No. 2 Area representatives conference, Tokyo, February 20, 2006.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1The Daishonin writes: \u201cYou lost your father at a very early age, and hence were deprived of his instruction and guidance. When I think of what this must have meant for you, I cannot restrain my tears\u201d (WND-2, 500).\n*2Eagle Peak: A term that symbolizes the Buddha land or the state of Buddhahood, as in the expression \u201cthe pure land of Eagle Peak.\u201d\n*3Myoho-renge-kyo is written with five Chinese characters, while Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is written with seven (nam, or namu, being comprised of two characters). The Daishonin often uses Myoho-renge-kyo synonymously with Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in his writings.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.6]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.8]"}, {"title": "chapter-10-8.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.8]\n10.8 Our Own Attainment of Buddhahood Enables the Deceased to Attain Buddhahood\nReferring to Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s writings, President Ikeda explains the principle that our efforts toward our own attainment of Buddhahood are the best offering we can make to the deceased.\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, Nichiren Daishonin states:\n\n\u201cNow when Nichiren and his followers perform ceremonies for the deceased, reciting the Lotus Sutra and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the ray of light from the daimoku reaches all the way to the hell of incessant suffering and makes it possible for them to attain Buddhahood then and there. This is the origin of the prayers for transference of merit for the deceased.\u201d (OTT, 17)\n\nThe power of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is unfathomable. The \u201clight\u201d of the daimoku we chant reaches every corner of the universe, illuminating even those agonizing in the hell of incessant suffering after death and enabling them to attain Buddhahood directly, says the Daishonin.\n\nIn \u201cThe Offering of an Unlined Robe,\u201d the Daishonin writes [to the lady of Sajiki]: \u201cBe firmly convinced that the benefits from this [your sincere offering] will extend to your parents, your grandparents, nay, even to countless living beings\u201d (WND-1, 533). The great benefit of our Buddhist practice dedicated to kosen-rufu also flows on to the deceased as well as to unborn future generations.\n\nOffering prayers based on the Mystic Law\u2014chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u2014 is the best and truest offering we can make for the deceased. Because the Mystic Law has the power to help all people attain Buddhahood, not only those here in the present but throughout the three existences of past, present, and future.\n\nThe father of one of the Daishonin\u2019s disciples, Joren-bo, was a Nembutsu practitioner. In a letter to Joren-bo after his father\u2019s death, the Daishonin writes: \u201cThe body that the father and mother leave behind is none other than the physical form and mind of the child. The blessings that you, the Honorable Joren, acquire through your faith in the Lotus Sutra will lend strength to your kind father\u201d (WND-2, 572).\n\nEven if our parents do not practice Nichiren Buddhism, the benefit that we receive as practitioners of the Mystic Law will also become their benefit. We are alive today thanks to our parents. They gave birth to us. As such, our attainment of Buddhahood leads to their attainment of Buddhahood.\n\nThe past doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019s the present that counts. Our ancestors\u2019 actions are not decisive; it is our actions that determine the future. All it takes is one awakened individual to shine like the sun and illuminate all of his or her family members and relations with the light of the Mystic Law.\n\nThe Daishonin notes that, without obtaining Buddhahood oneself, it would be difficult to help even one\u2019s parents attain Buddhahood, much less help other people to do so (cf. WND-1, 819). Let us take this insight deeply to heart.\n\nFrom a speech at a spring memorial service, Tokyo, March 21, 2006.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.7]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.9]"}, {"title": "chapter-10-9.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.9]\n10.9 Ties Based on the Mystic Law Are Eternal\nPresident Ikeda encourages a high school division member who asks if she will ever be reunited with her beloved grandmother, who has passed away.\nNichiren Daishonin says that we can be reunited with deceased loved ones. For example, he gently tells a mother who had lost her child*1:\n\n\u201cThere is a way to meet him [your deceased child] readily. With Shakyamuni Buddha as your guide, you can go to meet him in the pure land of Eagle Peak. . . . It could never happen that a woman who chants Nam-myoho-renge-kyo would fail to be reunited with her beloved child.\u201d (WND-1, 1092)\n\nBy saying that they will \u201cmeet in the pure land of Eagle Peak,\u201d the Daishonin is in effect saying: \u201cYour child has attained Buddhahood, and you can attain Buddhahood, too, with the result that you will both be together in the same realm of Buddhahood.\u201d\n\nThis could mean that a life that has merged with the universe can feel at one with the life of another, or that two lives can meet in another Buddha land somewhere else in the universe.\n\nRecently, it was estimated there are about 125 billion galaxies in the observable universe [according to observations with the Hubble Space Telescope by the American Astronomical Society in January 1999]. But compared to the Buddhist conception of the universe, that is still far from a large number. The \u201cLife Span\u201d (16th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra that we recite during gongyo offers an even grander view of the universe, on a scale that can only be conceived as infinite. At any rate, the Earth is not the only planet inhabited by life; countless others exist.\n\nYou may be reborn with your grandmother on one of the Buddha lands among those planets. Or you may be born together on a planet where kosen-rufu is still taking place, like the Earth, and work together to aid suffering beings there. The Lotus Sutra teaches that we can be reborn freely just as we desire.\n\nLife is eternal. Though you may be separated by death, in actuality, it is as if one of you had just gone off for a time on a trip overseas, and you couldn\u2019t meet for a while.\n\nAs a young man, Mr. Toda lost an infant daughter. Many years later, when encouraging someone who had lost a child and asked him whether it would be possible to forge a parent-child relationship with that child again in this lifetime, he said:\n\n\u201cI lost my infant daughter Yasuyo when I was 23. I held my dead child all through the night. At the time, not yet having taken faith in the Gohonzon, I was overcome with grief and fell asleep with her in my arms.\n\n\u201cAnd so we parted, and now I am 58. Since she was three when she died, she would now be a fine woman had she lived. Have I or have I not met my deceased daughter again in this life? This is a matter of one\u2019s own perception arising from faith. I believe that I have met her. Whether one is united with a deceased relative in this life or the next is all a matter of one\u2019s perception through faith.\u201d*2\n\nAfter Mr. Toda lost his daughter, his wife also passed away. He grieved terribly over their deaths, but he said that because he had experienced such personal loss and various other kinds of hardships he was able to encourage many others and to be a leader of the people who could understand their feelings.\n\nEverything that happens in life has meaning. If you press ahead undefeated, through the sadness, the pain, and the feeling you can\u2019t go on, the time will come when you see its meaning. That\u2019s the power of faith, and the essence of life.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth II, published in Japanese in September 2000.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1 Written to the lay nun Ueno, the mother of Nanjo Tokimitsu, upon the sudden death of Tokimitsu\u2019s youngest brother Shichiro Goro.\n*2 Translated from Japanese.

This devilish function serves to arouse doubt and confusion through the death of those striving diligently in Buddhist practice.\n\nWe all have our own karma, but as ordinary mortals we cannot grasp its depth. Even should steadfast practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism die young, their death will enable them to actualize the Buddhist principle of \u201clessening karmic retribution.\u201d*2\n\nThose who strive energetically for kosen-rufu as genuine practitioners of the Mystic Law are certain to attain Buddhahood, however their lives may end.\n\nAn early Buddhist scripture tells the story of a lay believer named Mahanama. He asked the Buddha where and in what form of existence he would be reborn were he to suddenly meet his end in an accident due to being distracted by the bustle of the town instead of concentrating his thoughts on the Three Treasures\u2014the Buddha, the Law, and the Buddhist Order.\n\nThe Buddha responded: \u201cFor instance, Mahanama, if a tree bends to the east, slopes to the east, tends to the east, which way will it fall when its root is cut?\u201d\n\nTo which Mahanama replied: \u201cIt will fall [in the direction that] it bends, slopes and tends.\u201d*3\n\nThrough this story, the Buddha taught that those who embrace Buddhism and practice assiduously, even if they were to meet with an unexpected, accidental death, will be carried by the Law in the direction of rebirth in good circumstances.\n\n*****\n\nShin\u2019ichi then began to talk about the death of Isamu Ishizaki [a central leader in Tottori Prefecture]: \u201cThere may be some members who are wondering why, given that he practiced Nichiren Buddhism, Mr. Ishizaki met with such an accident. The causes and effects inherent deep in our lives, the workings of our karma, are strict indeed. That is why, even if we practice Nichiren Buddhism, the manner of our death can occur in any number of ways.\n\n\u201cThere may be some who die giving their lives in the struggle to uphold Buddhism, like Mr. Makiguchi who died in prison for his beliefs. There may be some who die young as a result of illness or accidents. But when viewed through the eyes of faith, it all has some extremely profound meaning.\n\n\u201cThose who have dedicated their lives to working for kosen-rufu are Bodhisattvas of the Earth.*4 They are followers of the Buddha. Life is eternal. In light of the teaching of the Mystic Law, such people will absolutely attain Buddhahood. Their surviving family members will also definitely be protected. I state unequivocally that, as long as those left behind continue to persevere in faith, the good fortune and benefit accumulated through their loved ones\u2019 dedication to kosen-rufu will also pass on to them, and they will, without fail, enjoy unsurpassed happiness.\u201d\n\nHearing Shin\u2019ichi\u2019s tremendous conviction, the feelings of doubt that had been clouding the members\u2019 minds evaporated and the sun of hope began to rise in their hearts.\n\nShin\u2019ichi continued: \u201cBeing without a spouse or partner doesn\u2019t mean that we will never be happy. Prestige and wealth also do not guarantee happiness. True happiness, absolute happiness, is only found when we awaken to the fact that our lives embody the Mystic Law, carry out our human revolution, and manifest the great life state of Buddhahood through our Buddhist practice. We are born alone and we die alone. Only the Mystic Law has the power to protect us across the three existences of past, present, and future.\n\n\u201cIf you continue devoting yourselves earnestly to kosen-rufu, the Buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout the ten directions and three existences will protect you. Therefore, no matter what happens, no matter what others may say or how badly they may treat you, you must never be swayed or shaken. If you become cowardly and distance yourself from faith, you will only end up miserable.\n\n\u201cLife is eternal, but this present lifetime flashes by in an instant. I hope you will be aware of your mission in this existence, devote yourselves to kosen-rufu, and accumulate abundant good fortune.\u201d\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 10, \u201cBastion of the Pen\u201d chapter.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Three obstacles and four devils: Various obstacles and hindrances to the practice of Buddhism. The three obstacles are (1) the obstacle of earthly desires, (2) the obstacle of karma, and (3) the obstacle of retribution. The four devils are (1) the hindrance of the five components, (2) the hindrance of earthly desires, (3) the hindrance of death, and (4) the hindrance of the devil king.\n*2Lessening karmic retribution: This term, which literally means, \u201ctransforming the heavy and receiving it lightly,\u201d appears in the Nirvana Sutra. \u201cHeavy\u201d indicates negative karma accumulated over countless lifetimes in the past. As a benefit of protecting the correct teaching of Buddhism, we can experience relatively light karmic retribution in this lifetime, thereby expiating heavy karma that ordinarily would adversely affect us not only in this lifetime, but over many lifetimes to come.\n*3The Book of the Kindred Sayings (Sanyutta-Nik\u0101ya) or Grouped Suttas, Part 5, translated by Mrs. Rhys Davids (Oxford: Pali Text Society, 1994), p. 321.\n*4Bodhisattvas of the Earth: An innumerable host of bodhisattvas who emerge from beneath the earth and to whom Shakyamuni Buddha entrusts the propagation of the Mystic Law, or the essence of the Lotus Sutra, in the Latter Day of the Law.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.9]\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.11]"}, {"title": "chapter-10-11.html", "content": "Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.11]\n10.11 Clear Proof of Attaining Buddhahood\nWith reference to the writings of Nichiren Daishonin, President Ikeda describes the final moments of those who have remained fully committed to their faith throughout their lives.\nAccompanied by a group of French youth division members, I once visited [in 1993] the ch\u00e2teau where Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s life came to a close.*1 These words of the Renaissance giant were engraved on a bronze plaque in the bedroom where he died: \u201cA fulfilling life is long. As a well-spent day brings happy sleep, so a well-spent life brings happy death.\u201d\n\nThose who have lived a good life without regrets do not fear death. How much more certain it is, then, that a life spent striving tirelessly for others and for truth and goodness, in accord with the eternal Law pervading life and the universe, will reach the summit of true joy.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cContinue your practice without backsliding until the final moment of your life, and when that time comes, behold! When you climb the mountain of perfect enlightenment and gaze around you in all directions, then to your amazement you will see that the entire realm of phenomena is the Land of Tranquil Light. The ground will be of lapis lazuli, and the eight paths*2 will be set apart by golden ropes. Four kinds of flowers*3 will fall from the heavens, and music will resound in the air. All Buddhas and bodhisattvas will be present in complete joy, caressed by the breezes of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity. The time is fast approaching when we too will count ourselves among their number.\u201d (WND-1, 761)\n\nThis describes the state of life\u2014brimming with \u201cthe greatest of all joys\u201d (OTT, 212)\u2014found in the worlds of Buddhas and bodhisattvas that move in rhythm with the universe.\n\nThe Nanjo family made a lasting contribution to kosen-rufu during the Daishonin\u2019s lifetime. Nanjo Shichiro Goro, Nanjo Tokimitsu\u2019s youngest brother, died suddenly at the young age of 16. He was a youth of fine character and handsome appearance, and the Daishonin had high hopes for his future. His mother was pregnant with him when her husband died, and she loved him deeply.\n\nIntensely grieving Shichiro Goro\u2019s sudden death, the Daishonin repeatedly assured the Nanjo family that the deceased young man would attain Buddhahood without fail. In the postscript to one of his letters, he writes: \u201cHe had devoted himself to Shakyamuni Buddha and the Lotus Sutra, and he died in a fitting manner\u201d (WND-2, 887).\n\nThough someone may seem to have died prematurely or unexpectedly, there will be clear proof that they have attained Buddhahood. One manifestation of this is the fact that they are deeply mourned and missed by so many people. Another is the way in which the surviving family members go on to enjoy protection and prosperity. When a family carries on courageously with their lives after a loved one has passed away, the deceased continues to live on in their hearts.\n\nThe Daishonin encourages Shichiro Goro\u2019s mother:\n\n\u201cI hope that, if you, his loving mother, are thinking with longing about your son, you will chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and pray to be reborn in the same place as the late Shichiro Goro and your husband, the late Nanjo.\n\n\u201cThe seeds of one kind of plant are all the same; they are different from the seeds of other plants. If all of you nurture the same seeds of Myoho-renge-kyo in your hearts, then you all will be reborn together in the same land of Myoho-renge-kyo. When the three of you are reunited there face-to-face, how great your joy will be!\u201d (WND-1, 1074)\n\nBased on the profound teaching of the Mystic Law, the Daishonin offers a vision of the wondrous realm of happiness stretching out before us.\n\nFrom an essay series \u201cThoughts on The New Human Revolution,\u201d published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, November 3, 2000.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1Le Clos-Luc\u00e9, formerly the castle of Cloux, near Amboise, France; it is now a Leonardo da Vinci museum.\n*2The eight paths lead in eight directions, that is, toward the eight points of the compass..\n*3Four kinds of flowers: Mandarava, great mandarava, manjushaka, and great manjushaka flowers.

Though they had made the long trip to learn about the Buddhist teachings from him, they spent their days in the lodging where they were staying, engaged in idle conversation, laughing and amusing themselves.\n\nShakyamuni came to see them and said: \u201cAll beings rely on five things. What are the five? One, they rely on their youth. Two, they rely on their upright appearance. Three, they rely on their great strength. Four, they rely on their wealth. Five, they rely on their noble family. While you, seven sirs, are speaking in a low tone or loudly laughing, what do you rely on?\u201d*1\n\nShakyamuni then went on to tell them that life is uncertain and fleeting, characterized by the four sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death. Hearing Shakyamuni, the seven Brahmans realized for the first time what they should be doing and began to strive seriously in their practice.\n\n\u201cWhat do you rely on?\u201d Shakyamuni asked. In other words, what sustains you in this life?\n\nNichiren Daishonin teaches three treasures in life: the treasures of the storehouse, the treasures of the body, and the treasures of the heart (cf. WND-1, 851).\n\nThe five things that all beings rely on in the story all correspond to the treasures of the storehouse or the treasures of the body. Wealth, of course, corresponds to the treasures of the storehouse. Youth, beauty, health, and ability, along with social status, correspond to the treasures of the body. All of these things have value in life, and it may be natural, in that respect, for us to pursue them. But the question is whether they are really genuine treasures in life that can offer eternal sustenance.\n\nLet me give some concrete examples. Some people are harmed or killed for their wealth. Those who are physically attractive may be envied or exploited by others. Fame and power can lead people to become arrogant and ruin their lives, and there are many of high social position who allow themselves to be seduced by the devilish nature of power, to their own undoing. None of these so-called treasures continue forever.\n\nAs such, the treasures of the storehouse and the treasures of the body are not genuine sustenance that can provide true happiness. On their own, they cannot enable us to lead a life of real fulfillment.\n\nWhat do we need to live such a life? The Daishonin tells us: \u201cThe treasures of the heart are the most valuable of all\u201d (WND-1, 851).\n\nThe treasures of the heart refer to faith in the Mystic Law. Faith is the eternal treasure and sustenance of human life. It encompasses immeasurable benefit and boundless good fortune. Its power is as vast as the universe and can transform our entire environment or world. It is the source of inexhaustible joy and immense wisdom and compassion, enabling us to employ the treasures of the storehouse and the treasures of the body to attain eternal happiness.\n\nEach of you already possesses this supreme sustenance of life. All you have to do is tap its limitless power.\n\nLife is brief. Youth passes by in a flash, easily wasted in indecision, complaining, criticizing others, or being defeated by one\u2019s own laziness. Every day is precious.\n\nI hope you will spend your youth in a fulfilling manner, leading strong lives in the real world and at the same time contemplating the vast universe, pondering eternity, and making each day worth a thousand years, a thousand eons.\n\nFrom a speech at an Okinawa Prefecture youth division representatives training course, Okinawa, February 19, 1988.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works under key themes.\n*1The Scriptural Text: Verses of the Doctrine, with Parables, translated from the Chinese of Fa-li and Fa-ch\u00fc (Taisho Volume 4, Number 211) by Charles Willemen (Berkeley, California: Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research, 1999), p. 116.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.11]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 11: What Is Human Revolution?

Subsequent chapters will present excerpts offering more concrete encouragement for leading a life of human revolution.\n\nToday, August 6, is the anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima [in 1945]. On this date last year [1993], I began writing my novel The New Human Revolution here at the Nagano Training Center. It is grounded on the theme: \u201cA great human revolution in just a single individual will help achieve a change in the destiny of a nation and, further, will enable a change in the destiny of all humankind.\u201d This expresses in contemporary terms the Buddhist principle of \u201cthree thousand realms in a single moment of life.\u201d*1\n\nA transformation in our fundamental mind-set transforms the three realms of existences\u2014that is, the realm of the five components [form, perception, conception, volition, and consciousness, which are said to merge to form an individual being], the realm of living beings, and the realm of the environment. In other words, a change in our attitude or determination first effects a change in our own life. It can positively impact our health and vigor and allow us to bring forth limitless wisdom. Those who have transformed their lives in this way can guide others in the direction of happiness. They can also change society and the natural environment, transforming the world into a wonderful realm of peace and plenty.\n\nSuch are the workings of the principle of \u201cthree thousand realms in a single moment of life,\u201d the zenith of Buddhist philosophy.\n\nFrom a speech at a Nagano Prefecture general meeting, Nagano, August 6, 1994.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Three thousand realms in a single moment of life: A philosophical system established by the Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai of China based on the Lotus Sutra. The \u201cthree thousand realms\u201d indicates the varying aspects that life assumes at each moment. At each moment, life manifests one of the Ten Worlds. Each of these worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself, thus making one hundred possible worlds. Each of these hundred worlds possesses the ten factors and operates within each of the three realms of existence, thus making three thousand realms. In other words, all phenomena are contained within a single moment of life, and a single moment of life permeates the three thousand realms of existence, or the entire phenomenal world.\nPart 1: Happiness; Chapter 10:\nJoy in Both Life and Death [10.12]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 11: What Is Human Revolution?

[11.2]\n11.2 Establishing the Life State of Buddhahood\nPresident Ikeda clarifies why inner transformation is important, how we can achieve it, and the ultimate aim of doing so.\n\nNichiren Buddhism is a philosophy that teaches changing the world by transforming our inner state of being. Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cIf the minds of living beings are impure, their land is also impure, but if their minds are pure, so is their land. There are not two lands, pure or impure in themselves\u201d (WND-1, 4). \u201cLand\u201d here refers to the society and natural environment in which we live. The Daishonin is saying that our environment is not inherently either pure or impure. What makes it one way or the other is whether the minds of the people residing there are pure or impure. In other words, the key to changing society lies in transforming, or \u201crevolutionizing,\u201d the minds of human beings.\n\nBuddhism teaches that earthly desires\u2014the three poisons of greed, anger, and foolishness inherent in human life\u2014are the fundamental cause of unhappiness and suffering. Buddhahood is the underlying power of the universe that can vanquish these poisons. It is the highest and noblest state of life. Buddhism teaches that all people possess this life state within them.\n\nThe life state of Buddhahood, in short, is the function of supreme compassion and wisdom and the source of all life activity. Bringing forth our Buddhahood gives us the power to transcend the self that is controlled or swayed by desire and suffering, and establish our original, true self.\n\nBringing forth our innate Buddhahood and establishing it as our state of life is the path of \u201cattaining Buddhahood in this lifetime\u201d\u2014in other words, realizing a state of absolute happiness\u2014and the ultimate aim of human revolution.\n\nWhat, then, is the means for achieving this? The Daishonin expressed the great life state of Buddhahood, which is one with the fundamental Law of the universe, in the form of the Gohonzon, the true object of devotion, for the sake of all humanity in the Latter Day of the Law. It is by believing in the Gohonzon and dedicating ourselves to the mission of helping all people achieve happiness that we bring forth the Buddhahood within our own lives.\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 14, \u201cWisdom and Courage\u201d chapter.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 11: What Is Human Revolution?

[11.3]\n11.3 Human Revolution\u2014A Concept of Key Importance for the 21st Century\nResponding to a question from a high school student, President Ikeda explains human revolution in an accessible fashion.\n\nHuman revolution is not something unusual or special. For example, say that one day a boy who is always playing and never studies makes the decision, \u201cFrom now on, I\u2019m going to study\u201d or tells himself, \u201cI\u2019m going to make efforts for the sake of my future.\u201d When he does that, he is engaging in human revolution.\n\nLet\u2019s say a mother is only concerned about the welfare of her own family. Then, one day, she says to herself: \u201cThere\u2019s no way of knowing that our present happiness will continue forever. I\u2019m going to seek a more permanent kind of happiness.\u201d Then, through her Buddhist faith and practice, she becomes a powerful support for her entire family. That\u2019s human revolution for that mother.\n\nSuppose there\u2019s a father who only thinks about himself, his own family, and his friends. Then, one day, he decides to take a step beyond that limited realm of concern and reach out with compassion to those who are ill or suffering, to find a way to enable them to lead happy lives. That is the father\u2019s human revolution.\n\nIn other words, human revolution is opening your eyes wide and looking beyond your ordinary concerns, striving for and dedicating your actions to something higher, deeper, and broader.\n\nSomeone who at first may seem to be a hopeless case can, by achieving a major self-transformation through their Buddhist practice, become an inspiration to countless others.\n\nAlso, times when you are suffering intensely, when you don\u2019t know what to do or which way to turn, can become important opportunities for making great strides in your human revolution.\n\nIf you tend to be easily discouraged, just refresh your determination each time that happens. People who are resolved to see problems as opportunities and keep trying again and again, forging ahead with unflagging optimism, will definitely succeed in their human revolution.\n\nOur lives as human beings are a complex fabric of many factors\u2014our personalities, habits, karma, and family connections among them\u2014in which we can easily become entangled and unable to free ourselves. People spend their days fussing and fretting about immediate, minor problems, and before they know it, their lives are over. Many end their lives still trapped in the cycle of the six paths, or lower six worlds\u2014that is, the worlds of hell, hungry spirits, animals, asuras, human beings, and heavenly beings.*1\n\nHuman revolution is a revolution in our actions and behavior. It means to purposefully engage in behavior that is grounded in compassion, in actions that break free from the cycle of the six paths and bring us to the worlds of bodhisattvas and Buddhas.\n\nWhen human revolution spreads to the family, the country, and the world, it becomes a noble and bloodless revolution for peace.\n\nThere are many kinds of revolutions\u2014political, economic, industrial, scientific, and artistic; there are revolutions in the distribution of goods and services, in communications, and countless other spheres. Each is significant in its own way, and sometimes necessary. But whatever changes are made, if the people implementing them are selfish and lack compassion, they won\u2019t improve the world. Human revolution is the most fundamental revolution, and indeed the most essential revolution for humankind.\n\nHuman revolution will be a primary focus for the world in the future. It is the spiritual basis for orienting everything in a new and positive direction, including our views of life, society, and peace. I believe that human revolution will be a concept of key importance for the 21st century.\n\n\u201cRevolution\u201d means to turn things around. It signifies a sudden, radical change.\n\nThe natural process is for people to grow little by little, with the passage of time. Human revolution is a step beyond that gradual process, propelling us rapidly in a positive direction. And while it is a rapid improvement, it is also growth that continues throughout our lives. There is no end point. And our Buddhist practice is the engine, the driving force, for our human revolution.\n\nThere are countless books of moral teachings that have existed for thousands of years. There are also self-help and inspirational books, but achieving human revolution or changing our karma cannot be realized through words alone.\n\nThe Soka Gakkai has consistently followed the path not of abstract arguments but of actual human revolution\u2014transforming our minds, orienting them in the direction of supreme goodness in our real lives through concrete action.\n\nFundamentally, human revolution is achieved by uniting with the life of the Buddha. Through attaining the \u201cfusion of reality and wisdom\u201d*2 with the Buddha, the power for self-transformation wells up within us.\n\nOnly human beings have the ability to seek growth and self-improvement. We have the capacity to consciously change the direction of our lives, to enrich and deepen our lives instead of just allowing them to flow on aimlessly.\n\nPeople tend to view the way to greatness as rising within the ranks of society. But human revolution is bettering ourselves in a more profound, inner way. It also has an eternal aspect. It is far superior to mere social advancement.\n\nHuman beings always remain human beings; we can\u2019t transform ourselves into some higher being. That\u2019s why the most important thing is to transform ourselves as human beings. We can try to adorn ourselves with fame, social status, academic credentials, knowledge, or money, but if we are impoverished in terms of our own humanity, our lives remain poor and empty inside.\n\nWhat matters is who we are when all the external things are stripped away; who we are as ourselves. Human revolution is transforming that inner core, our lives, our selves.\n\nShakyamuni was a prince, but he abandoned all the trappings of his royal status to seek the truth about life. That was his human revolution. Nichiren Daishonin also openly declared himself to be of the lowest social rank in his day, \u201cthe son of a chandala family\u201d (WND-1, 202).\n\nHuman beings fought two world wars in the 20th century. Hundreds of millions of people experienced hellish suffering. What was the cause? If we ponder that, we arrive at the inevitable conclusion that human beings themselves must change\u2014that we must transform ourselves into beings of compassion.\n\nToday, many are concerned about a new rise in nationalism and authoritarianism. The great tragedy of World War II that occurred just a half century ago is being forgotten. That\u2019s why the presence of the Soka Gakkai, an unwavering proponent of peace, is so important.\n\nSecond Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda spent two years in prison during World War II, standing firm against Japanese militarism. This is what inspired me to join the Soka Gakkai. It made me decide that I could trust him. I didn\u2019t know anything about Buddhism. I had faith in Mr. Toda as a human being. And walking the path of oneness of mentor and disciple with him has been my path of human revolution.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth, published in Japanese in March 1999.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1The worlds of hell, hungry spirits, animals, asuras, human beings, and heavenly beings are known as the six paths, or the six lower worlds, while the worlds of voice-hearers, cause-awakened ones, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas are known as the four noble worlds. Together they are referred to as the Ten Worlds. They are also referred to as the ten life states of hell, hunger, animality, anger, humanity, heaven, learning, realization, bodhisattva, and Buddhahood.\n*2Fusion of reality and wisdom: The fusion of the objective reality or truth and the subjective wisdom to realize that truth, which is the Buddha nature inherent within one\u2019s life.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 11: What Is Human Revolution?

[11.4]\n11.4 Indicators of Human Revolution\nA solemn gongyo service marking the 17th memorial (16th anniversary) of the death of second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda was held in the United States on April 2, 1974. In The New Human Revolution, Shin\u2019ichi Yamamoto (whose character represents President Ikeda) addresses the members present at that gathering, mainly youth division representatives. After touching on the life philosophy of Mr. Toda, he discusses the significance of human revolution and suggests several concrete indicators for measuring our progress in this inner transformation.\n\nOne of Josei Toda\u2019s great achievements was to explain the complex teachings of Buddhism in easily comprehensible, contemporary terms.\n\nThe British philosopher Alfred North Whitehead wrote: \u201c[Religion\u2019s] principles may be eternal, but the expression of those principles requires continual development.\u201d*1\n\nFor example, while in prison, Mr. Toda realized that \u201cBuddha\u201d means life itself. He went on to articulate an understanding of Buddhism in terms of life, with the result that Buddhism was reborn as a living philosophy that could illuminate the present.\n\nHe also used the term \u201chuman revolution\u201d as a modern expression for attaining the life state of Buddhahood, the ultimate aim of Buddhist practice.\n\nIn Japanese society, the attainment of Buddhahood had long been viewed as a state realized only after death. By introducing this new concept of human revolution, Mr. Toda clarified and deepened people\u2019s understanding of Buddhahood as the goal for perfecting oneself as a human being in this present life.\n\nOur aim in exerting ourselves in Buddhist practice is human revolution.\n\nShin\u2019ichi wanted the young people present to realize that Nichiren Buddhism is a teaching of human revolution. He also wanted to outline for them some concrete indicators of human revolution.\n\nGazing intently at the participants, he continued: \u201cOur lives, our physical bodies, are entities of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. Human revolution is to manifest the life state of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.\n\n\u201cWhat does human revolution actually mean or look like? I would like to outline some indicators or measures for you today.\n\n\u201cFirst is health. Let\u2019s strive to clearly demonstrate actual proof of faith by leading a healthy life. Naturally, we all have our own karma, but generally speaking, we can\u2019t work our hardest if our health is compromised. Of course, we are physical beings, and there are times when we are bound to fall ill. But we should always chant earnestly for health and strive to profoundly align our lives with the fundamental rhythm of the universe. Without such prayer and efforts to lead a healthy, well-balanced life, we cannot be said to be practicing properly.\u201d\n\nThe young people gazed at Shin\u2019ichi intently as he spoke.\n\nThe second indicator he named is youthfulness. Maintaining a youthful spirit throughout life is a sign of human revolution. Striving energetically in our Buddhist practice and continuing tirelessly to polish and develop ourselves will keep us from losing our spiritual youthfulness.\n\nAs the third, Shin\u2019ichi specified good fortune. By continuing to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, dedicating ourselves to kosen-rufu, and triumphing as Buddhists in our daily lives, we adorn ourselves and our families with good fortune. In our turbulent society, such good fortune protects us and brings vibrant prosperity.\n\nFourth, Shin\u2019ichi cited wisdom. To strive to perfect ourselves as human beings and grow into effective leaders of society, we must polish our wisdom and intellect. Neglecting that will consign us to defeat in society.\n\nFifth, Shin\u2019ichi listed passion. Genuine practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism burn with a passionate commitment for kosen-rufu that invigorates their lives. We can possess all the intelligence in the world, but without passion we are like the living dead. Passion is also a requirement for happiness. Whether we are happy or unhappy in life is for the most part determined by our degree of passion.\n\nSixth, Shin\u2019ichi mentioned conviction. Human revolution is a brilliant reflection of our firm belief. Without a philosophy for living and firm convictions, we are like a ship without a compass. With no idea of the direction we should be taking, we can be blown about by the winds of karma and end up like a ship wrecked on the reefs.\n\nThe seventh and final indicator of human revolution, Shin\u2019ichi explained, is victory. Buddhism is a struggle to be victorious. Human revolution is achieved by accomplishing one victory after another. A winning life is a life of human revolution. Everything in both life and kosen-rufu is a struggle. Being victorious is the way to demonstrate proof of justice and truth.\n\nAfter presenting these seven indicators of human revolution\u2014health, youthfulness, good fortune, wisdom, passion, conviction, and victory\u2014Shin\u2019ichi stressed the development of compassion as an essential foundation for all practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism that encompasses all seven elements.\n\nShin\u2019ichi shared Mr. Toda\u2019s guidance on compassion with his listeners, stressing that, for us ordinary mortals, acting with courage is the best way to manifest compassion. He also emphasized the importance and nobility of devoting our lives to kosen-rufu as the practice of compassion and courage.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn short, awakening to our mission as Bodhisattvas of the Earth*2 is crucial for human revolution, and joyous and courageous dedication to kosen-rufu is a manifestation of human revolution.\n\n\u201cThose who uphold the correct teaching of Buddhism and dedicate themselves to the welfare of others and the betterment of society are truly noble. They express the state of life of bodhisattvas, regardless of their financial means or social status.\n\n\u201cThe Soka Gakkai extends its hand to those who are suffering most and strives to help them revitalize their spirits. The first three presidents of the Soka Gakkai have dedicated their lives to that purpose.\u201d\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 19, \u201cSunlight\u201d chapter.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Alfred North Whitehead, Science and the Modern World (New York: The Free Press, 1967), p. 189.\n*2Bodhisattvas of the Earth: An innumerable host of bodhisattvas who emerge from beneath the earth and to whom Shakyamuni Buddha entrusts the propagation of the Mystic Law, or the essence of the Lotus Sutra, in the Latter Day of the Law.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 11: What Is Human Revolution?

In other words, they started practicing for their own sakes. But the Daishonin writes: \u201cYou must not only persevere yourself; you must also teach others\u201d (WND-1, 386). In addition to striving in faith ourselves, he says, it is important that we also help others do the same. Basically, it is by working for kosen-rufu out of a wish for the happiness of others that we ourselves become truly happy. This is the fusion of practice for self and practice for others. Our own struggles and earthly desires become the driving force for the ultimate bodhisattva practice that is kosen-rufu.\n\nAs we do our best for the welfare of others, we break out of our narrow lesser self that is focused only on personal concerns, and gradually expand and elevate our life state. The commitment to others\u2019 well-being is what propels us to transform our life state and carry out our human revolution.\n\nThe lives of Soka Gakkai members, who pray wholeheartedly for the happiness of their friends and earnestly share the Daishonin\u2019s teachings with others, brim with joy, courage, and hope. Though we may be struggling with various health, financial, or other problems, we can overcome them confidently, like an accomplished surfer who enjoys riding big waves.\n\nThe true great benefit of faith is this fundamental inner transformation and human revolution. According to the principle of the oneness of life and its environment, when our life state changes, we are able to change our environment as well, and thereby resolve all of our problems.\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 19, \u201cRainbow of Hope\u201d chapter.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 11: What Is Human Revolution?

[11.6]\n11.6 A Never-ending Effort to Transform Reality\nBased on the Buddhist teaching of the true aspect of all phenomena, President Ikeda explains that a change in our own lives always results in a change in our environment. \u201cThere can be no happiness exclusively for the self,\u201d he says, \u201cnor unhappiness exclusively for others.\u201d\n\nI am President Toda\u2019s disciple; this is my greatest source of pride. While in prison, Mr. Toda read the Lotus Sutra with his life. Many other learned Buddhist practitioners through the ages have claimed to understand the Lotus Sutra. Some of them even became founders of their own Buddhist schools.\n\nBut Mr. Toda was different. When a journalist once asked him, \u201cAre you a Buddha?\u201d he replied, \u201cI\u2019m a proud common mortal!\u201d\n\nWarmly embracing the common people as they enacted dramas of rebirth and renewal from despair, he stood tall and firm in the midst of life\u2019s tempests. His life was the very embodiment of human revolution.\n\nIn that single term \u201chuman revolution,\u201d he broke free from the trap of self-righteousness and hypocrisy into which religion so easily falls, and magnificently merged Buddhism\u2019s supreme wisdom, the ideal way of human life, and the path to building a better society.\n\nHuman revolution is also a social revolution and a revolution of the environment.\n\nIn his writing \u201cThe True Aspect of All Phenomena,\u201d Nichiren Daishonin cites the Great Teacher Miao-lo\u2019s Annotations on \u201cThe Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra,\u201d where it states: \u201cLiving beings and their environments always manifest Myoho-renge-kyo\u201d*1 (WND-1, 383). The Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai also says: \u201cThe realm of the environment also has the ten factors\u201d*2 (WND-1, 356).\n\nLiving beings and their environments are not separate. They are one and indivisible. This is the source of the principle that the transformation of the individual leads to the transformation of the land and society.\n\nFrom the Buddhist perspective of the true aspect of all phenomena, all the many and varied phenomena of the universe are a single living entity. Happiness for the individual alone is impossible, and peace in terms of the environment alone is impossible. There can be no happiness exclusively for the self, nor unhappiness exclusively for others. The happier we make others, the happier we are, and as long as a single miserable person exists, our own happiness cannot be complete. This is the meaning of the true aspect of all phenomena. Hence, the heart of this teaching is a never-ending effort to transform reality.\n\nDescribing his motivation for composing the treatise \u201cOn Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land,\u201d Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cI say all this solely for the sake of the nation, for the sake of the Law, for the sake of others, not for my own sake\u201d (WND-1, 164). The fiercest storms of persecution could not extinguish the flame of the Daishonin\u2019s passionate commitment to relieve all people of suffering.\n\nFounding Soka Gakkai president Tsunesaburo Makiguchi inherited this spirit and raised high the banner of the Daishonin\u2019s ideal of \u201cestablishing the correct teaching for the peace of the land,\u201d dying in prison for his beliefs. Mr. Toda stood up alone in the devastation of postwar Japan with the same motivation.\n\nThe Daishonin states: \u201cThe very heart of the Lotus Sutra is the teaching that earthly desires are enlightenment, and that the sufferings of birth and death are nirvana\u201d (OTT, 173\u201374); and \u201cIt is this doctrine of three thousand realms in a single moment of life*3 that is capable of freeing one from suffering and bringing one joy\u201d (OTT, 173).\n\nThe aim of Buddhism, and the aim of the Soka Gakkai, is to free all living beings from suffering. The Soka Gakkai strives arduously to enable all people to become happy. There is no other reason for its existence.\n\nHow admirable and noble are those who advance together with the Soka Gakkai!\n\nFrom the perspective of the true aspect of all phenomena, here and now constitute the eternal and original, the true and fundamental, stage of our lives. The Daishonin makes this point clearly when he affirms: \u201cIt is not that he [the Buddha] leaves his present place and goes to some other place\u201d (OTT, 192).\n\nEven if the place or sphere of activity where we find ourselves is so challenging that it feels like it is some kind of karmic retribution, it is actually the perfect place for us to fulfill our original mission. In that sense, those who awaken to the wisdom of the true aspect of all phenomena will lead lives in which any negative karma is transformed into brilliant mission.\n\nOnce we are certain of this, we are filled with hope. Every person and situation we encounter becomes a precious treasure.\n\nThe great Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore sang: \u201cSweet is the world, sweet the dust of it.\u201d*4 And describing a mother\u2019s feelings for her child, he wrote:\n\n\u201cWhen I bring to you coloured toys, my child, I understand why there is such a play of colours on clouds, on water, and why flowers are painted in tints\u2014when I give coloured toys to you, my child.\n\n\u201cWhen I sing to make you dance I truly know why there is music in leaves, and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart of the listening earth\u2014when I sing to make you dance.\u201d*5\n\nA mother\u2019s love for her child is a colorful realm, a realm in which the vibrant music of life resonates. Love transcends the gap between individuals and opens the heart to the truth that all life is one.\n\nThat\u2019s why, as we strive to embrace all humanity with love and compassion, we are filled with the glorious hues and music of life.\n\nWhen we are fully aware of the true aspect of all phenomena, the place we are now becomes the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light.*6\n\nAs Mr. Toda said, being alive becomes an absolute delight in itself. The Lotus Sutra teaches us to lead lives dedicated to the challenge of creating and spreading that realm of great joy in the real world.\n\nFrom The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra, vol. 1, published in Japanese in March 1996\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Myoho-renge-kyo is written with five Chinese characters, while Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is written with seven (nam, or namu, being comprised of two characters). The Daishonin, however, often uses Myoho-renge-kyo synonymously with Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in his writings.\n*2The ten factors of life are ten aspects shared by all living beings of the Ten Worlds\u2014appearance, nature, entity, power, influence, internal cause, relation, latent effect, manifest effect, and their consistency from beginning to end.\n*3Three thousand realms in a single moment of life: A philosophical system established by the Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai of China based on the Lotus Sutra. The \u201cthree thousand realms\u201d indicates the varying aspects that life assumes at each moment. At each moment, life manifests one of the Ten Worlds. Each of these worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself, thus making one hundred possible worlds. Each of these hundred worlds possesses the ten factors and operates within each of the three realms of existence, thus making three thousand realms. In other words, all phenomena are contained within a single moment of life, and a single moment of life permeates the three thousand realms of existence, or the entire phenomenal world.\n*4Rabindranath Tagore, Wings of Death: The Last Poems of Rabindranath Tagore, translated by Aurobindo Bose (London: John Murray, 1960), p. 69.\n*5Rabindranath Tagore, Gitanjali (Song Offerings): A Collection of Prose Translations Made by the Author from the Original Bengali (London: Macmillan and Co., Limited, 1915), p. 57.\n*6Land of Eternally Tranquil Light: Also, Land of Tranquil Light. The Buddha land, which is free from impermanence and impurity. In many sutras, the actual saha world in which human beings dwell is described as an impure land filled with delusions and sufferings, while the Buddha land is described as a pure land free from these and far removed from this saha world. In contrast, the Lotus Sutra reveals the saha world to be the Buddha land, or the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light, and explains that the nature of a land is determined by the minds of its inhabitants.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 11: What Is Human Revolution?

Encouraging her fellow prisoners, she transformed the jail into a school and a theater. Referring to the example of Ms. Sats, President Ikeda speaks of the significance of making our daily lives a drama of human revolution, and tells us that true human revolution is achieved amid the struggle to overcome life\u2019s hardships and adversity.\n\nWhen we change our state of mind, our environment also changes. Buddhism teaches this in the doctrines of \u201cthe oneness of life and its environment\u201d and \u201cthree thousand realms in a single moment of life.\u201d*1\n\nLooking around her in prison, Natalya Sats saw women with all kinds of diverse and wonderful talents. There was no use in regretting her situation. She thought: \u201cLet\u2019s make this an opportunity to learn from one another, each sharing our special talents. Let\u2019s start a school. This one can lecture on science, and that one can teach us medicine.\u201d\n\nMs. Sats had a beautiful voice. On one occasion, she recited a poem by Pushkin. Her fellow prisoners were deeply moved and encouraged.\n\nThe prison was dark and shut off from the rest of the world. That made it an ideal place for quiet study. It also became a stage where they could enjoy performances. A change in one\u2019s state of mind can change everything.\n\nMs. Sats decided to try to make each day as enjoyable and meaningful as possible.\n\nTruly wise individuals can create value under any circumstances.\n\nBuddhism teaches that \u201cthe mind is like a skilled painter\u201d (WND-1, 226). It can freely depict anything. Life itself is a great painting depicted by our minds. It is a work of art created by our minds.\n\nMs. Sats decided with her fellow prisoners that no one should be left sad and alone.\n\nBeing alone only intensifies our sadness and makes it harder to relieve.\n\nPeople are social beings. Our interactions with one another are what make us fully human; they mutually enrich us.\n\nCertainly, there may be times when being a member of an organization seems bothersome and we just want to be alone. But if we actually seclude ourselves from others, and that leads us to stop practicing, how much sadder and lonelier we would be!\n\nWe achieve growth through interacting with our fellow human beings, sharing one another\u2019s ups and downs, joys and sufferings, in a lively human world.\n\nAs her example shows, Ms. Sats was a wise philosopher and humanist.\n\nOne need not profess lofty theories to be a humanist. All that is required is to truly believe in people and strive to bring them together. This is true humanism. It is none other than forging friendships.\n\nFriendship is strong. The underlying strength of the Soka Gakkai is also friendship, fellowship, and solid unity in faith. The organizational structure comes after that. We must never get things the wrong way round.\n\nThe organization is a means for deepening friendship, fellowship, and faith. Reversing these priorities would be fatal. When the organization becomes a priority for its own sake, it will be afflicted by the evils of authoritarianism.\n\nThrough Soka Gakkai activities that spread friendship in our communities and in society, we are accumulating treasures in life day after day.\n\nWe are practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism. Let\u2019s strive to live our lives in a way that inspires others to admire and want to emulate us, and enact our own personal dramas of human revolution in life in our own unique way.\n\nThe key is transforming ourselves.\n\nThere is no better life than one spent creating our own unique drama of human revolution, in our own unique way, day after day. The growth we display in the process is itself a wonderful way to communicate the greatness of Nichiren Buddhism to others.\n\nAllow me to share with you a familiar passage from the Daishonin\u2019s writing \u201cThe Opening of the Eyes\u201d:\n\n\u201cAlthough I and my disciples may encounter various difficulties, if we do not harbor doubts in our hearts, we will as a matter of course attain Buddhahood. Do not have doubts [about the benefit of upholding the Lotus Sutra] simply because heaven does not lend you protection. Do not be discouraged because you do not enjoy an easy and secure existence in this life. This is what I have taught my disciples morning and evening, and yet they begin to harbor doubts and abandon their faith.\n\n\u201cFoolish men are likely to forget the promises they have made when the crucial moment comes.\u201d (WND-1, 283)\n\nThe Daishonin assures us that if we keep striving in faith throughout our lives, we are certain to attain Buddhahood, and he therefore urges us to do so no matter what difficulties we may encounter along the way.\n\nAs the Daishonin writes, \u201cThis life is like a dream. One cannot be sure that one will live until tomorrow\u201d (WND-1, 824). Given life\u2019s uncertainty and our inability to control it, it\u2019s important that we strive to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime, establishing an inner life state of limitless freedom that will endure throughout eternity. This is the purpose of faith. Our victory in this existence hinges on establishing such a state of life.\n\nWe cannot change our life state through science, politics, or economics\u2014it can only be done through practicing the teachings of Nichiren Buddhism. And we have the great good fortune to have encountered this Buddhism in the present existence.\n\n\u201cDo not have doubts simply because heaven does not lend you protection,\u201d writes the Daishonin. From the long-term perspective, benefit will definitely be forthcoming. Though the situation may seem bad, we are certain to be able to change poison into medicine.*2\n\n\u201cDo not be discouraged because you do not enjoy an easy and secure existence in this life,\u201d the Daishonin says. An easy and secure existence does not make us stronger. Being able to eat and sleep whenever we please can simply make us lazy and complacent.\n\nBy fighting against adversity, we establish a diamond-like state of life. That\u2019s why the Daishonin writes: \u201cDifficulties will arise, and these are to be looked on as [peace and comfort]\u201d (cf. OTT, 115).\n\nBuddhist practice is filled with difficult challenges, but it enables us to experience the great joy of human revolution, which would never be possible from a life of complete ease. That\u2019s why the Daishonin sternly warns us not to forget at a crucial moment, the promises we have made in faith.\n\nFrom a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Tokyo, December 16, 1996.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Three thousand realms in a single moment of life: A philosophical system established by the Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai of China based on the Lotus Sutra.

[11.8]\n11.8 A Process of Unending Inner Transformation and Self-Improvement\nHuman revolution is one of the major themes of President Ikeda\u2019s dialogue with cofounder of the Club of Rome Aurelio Peccei. This section introduces several aspects of human revolution that President Ikeda discussed in the dialogue.\n\nThe term \u201chuman revolution\u201d was first employed in the context of the Soka Gakkai by its second president, Josei Toda. President Toda was imprisoned during World War II by the militarist Japanese government authorities for his steadfast practice of Nichiren Buddhism. During his incarceration, he had a profound religious awakening, which led him to decide to dedicate his life to propagating Nichiren Buddhism. Mr. Toda called this inner transformation that he experienced \u201chuman revolution.\u201d\n\nAfter the war, he elaborated on his experience, referring to the example of the main character in the novel The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas. The novel\u2019s hero undergoes a transformation from a pure-hearted youth to a man burning with the desire to bring to justice those who had wronged him. That is his human revolution. Mr. Toda\u2019s personal human revolution was becoming a man burning with the determination to lead all people to happiness by propagating the correct teaching of Buddhism. It was a transformation from a life based on self-interest to a life based on a firmly held conviction. In our case, that conviction is, fundamentally, to propagate Nichiren Buddhism, which is inextricably linked to empowering others to become happy.\n\nBuddhism also teaches establishing a state of self-mastery free from the domination of selfish desires and instinctual impulses, and having attained that state, living in cooperation and harmony with others, feeling compassionate concern for all life, and acting for the happiness and welfare of all people. The fundamental issue for all practitioners of Buddhism is transforming and perfecting the self with the aim of becoming such a human being. The complete achievement of that ideal is called \u201cattaining Buddhahood,\u201d and human revolution is the process of engaging in Buddhist practice toward realizing that ultimate aim.\n*\nGenerally speaking, in the history of humankind\u2014and since the dawn of the modern age, in particular\u2014it has come to be believed that the key to human happiness lies in transforming our external world, our natural environment or our social systems, and this has been the primary focus. In the process, it is perhaps no exaggeration to say that little thought has been devoted to transforming the way we live our lives, and efforts to regulate and control the inner workings of our hearts and minds have been depreciated or dismissed. But today, the task of transforming and elevating our inner, spiritual world has grown increasingly important. We call that effort human revolution.\n*\nWe human beings are easily influenced by life\u2019s inherent impulses, the three poisons of greed, anger, and foolishness. We are fragile beings, like tiny vessels on a wild sea that are easily swayed or swamped by the powerful waves of destiny and karma. Just as a great storm may sweep a small boat to some uncharted destination, we are often impelled to act in ways that defy reason, allowing short-term self-interest to undermine our very survival. For example, though we know rationally that we must care for and preserve our environment, we destroy and pollute it for immediate gain. Or to give another example, though rationally we wish for peace, we allow insecurity and fear to drive us to fortify our military arsenals, creating the opportunity for a minor incident to trigger a great and terrible war. Things of this sort have occurred repeatedly in history.\n\nIn order to protect ourselves from such forces of impulse, as well as the forces of destiny that drive individuals and societies at an even deeper level\u2014like invisible ocean currents overwhelming and carrying away a fragile craft\u2014we must possess a powerful commitment to humanism.\n\nBuddhism teaches that a vast and powerful entity, the \u201cgreat self\u201d of the universe in its entirety, exists deep in the innermost being of each individual. It calls that entity the Buddha nature, and teaches how we can open and manifest our Buddha nature and demonstrate its power in our actual lives and actions.\n*\nNeedless to say, living in the real world as we do, none of us is perfect. Those who achieve their human revolution have not attained perfection, either. Human revolution entails a clear awakening to our purpose in life, followed by the effort to approach the state of perfection a little at a time, keeping that purpose clearly in mind. Human revolution is not a final goal that can be realized; rather, it is a change in the course, the direction of our lives.\n\nAs a result, at any fixed point in time, those striving for human revolution will naturally have faults and deficiencies, just as all people do, and may appear no different from others. But on the inside, those engaged in human revolution are completely different from the people they were before they embarked on this spiritual adventure, and over the long term, their differences from others will become apparent. This is our conception of the process of human revolution.\n\nFrom Before It Is Too Late, published in Japanese in October 1984.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 11: What Is Human Revolution?

But when we have the positive attitude that we can transform karma into mission, then life\u2019s winters will always give way to spring\u2014or rather, we will be able to experience life\u2019s winters, just as they are, as spring.\n\nFor what purpose will we use our precious lives? From the moment we awaken deeply to our mission, the drama of changing our karma and accomplishing our human revolution begins to unfold on a grand scale.\n\nIn this selection, through the principle of \u201cvoluntarily assuming the appropriate karma\u201d taught in the Lotus Sutra, President Ikeda explains that, regardless of the adversities we may encounter in life, when we base ourselves on the Mystic Law, we can transform all negative karma into our mission.\n\nMy mentor, second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda, said: \u201cSuffering is a part of life. Without suffering, we wouldn\u2019t be able to savor true enjoyment or pleasure. When we fully grasp this, being alive in itself becomes enjoyable. That is the ultimate purpose of our Buddhist practice.\u201d\n\nHe also said: \u201cAny organization or group, as it grows, will experience various problems and mishaps. This is inevitable. But the power of the Mystic Law enables us to solve such issues and ensure that our organization continues to develop. This is the way of value creation.\u201d\n\nThe driving force for changing suffering into joy and adversity into the energy for dynamic development is our Buddhist practice and Soka Gakkai activities.\n\nThe more challenging the obstacles we overcome, the more dramatically we can transform our karma and the bigger, better people we can become.\n\nDay after day, many people share with me that they have come to enjoy good health and well-being through practicing Nichiren Buddhism. Nothing makes me happier.\n\nMr. Toda encouraged a member suffering from illness: \u201cWhen you trip over a stone and fall, you place your hands on the ground and push yourself up again. In the same way, please transform your karma of illness into mission and overcome it through practicing Nichiren Buddhism.\u201d\n\nHe also said: \u201cThe Lotus Sutra teaches that the Buddha, too, suffered from sickness. In one of his commentaries, the Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai says that all living beings are subject to illness, so it would be difficult to relate to the Buddha if he didn\u2019t also experience illness.\u201d*1\n\nThe Lotus Sutra teaches the principle of \u201cvoluntarily assuming the appropriate karma.\u201d*2 Bodhisattvas vow to free people from suffering, and to fulfill their vow they deliberately choose to be born into this world of suffering and evil (cf. LSOC10, 200, 202).\n\nWhen we base our lives on faith in the Mystic Law, we can always change our karma into mission, however daunting the problems we face.\n\nIn the Soka Gakkai, we have fellow members we can strive together with. We have encouragement and hope. The vibrant heart-to-heart interaction we share is a truly wonderful source of vitality for living long, healthy and fulfilling lives.\n\nThe Soka Gakkai is an unsurpassed haven of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity.\n\nFrom a speech at a Yamanashi Prefecture executive conference, Yamanashi, September 3, 2006.\n*1Translated from Japanese.

Being able to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is in itself proof of a deep karmic connection from the past.\n\nThe Daishonin also writes: \u201cIf you are of the same mind as Nichiren, you must be a Bodhisattva of the Earth\u201d (WND-1, 385). Young people who dedicate their lives to kosen-rufu and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo are all supremely respectworthy Bodhisattvas of the Earth.\n\nYou are chanting daimoku for the happiness of others and the realization of kosen-rufu. You are engaging in Soka Gakkai activities and striving to share Nichiren Buddhism with those around you. Such prayers and actions are themselves expressions of your vow for kosen-rufu.\n\nIn the \u201cEmerging from the Earth\u201d (15th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra, the Bodhisattvas of the Earth emerge from beneath the earth and vow to propagate the Lotus Sutra in the Latter Day of the Law. In accord with that vow, we have been born in this world and are working for the sake of kosen-rufu as Soka Gakkai members. We are deeply and strongly connected to one another through our prayers based on our shared vow.\n\nThe Soka Gakkai is an organization carrying out the Buddha\u2019s intent, its members standing up with an awareness of their mission as Bodhisattvas of the Earth. How noble this is. Without this profound commitment, we cannot repel the attacks of the three powerful enemies*2 and advance kosen-rufu in the evil age of the Latter Day of the Law.\n\nBodhisattvas of the Earth always emerge courageously in the most challenging times and the most challenging places.\n\nThe difficulties you may now be facing are, from the perspective of faith in Nichiren Buddhism, part of your chosen mission. Forging ahead with that conviction is proof that your prayers are infused with the vow for kosen-rufu.\n\nIf you have some pressing problem\u2014be it work, money, health, a relationship, or some other challenge\u2014it is important that you chant earnestly to triumph over it. Your own clear proof of victory will become a source of hope and inspiration for others experiencing the same kind of problems.\n\nWe can transform karma into mission through chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with the recognition that we have voluntarily assumed the appropriate karma*3 in order to show others the power of the Mystic Law in this lifetime.\n\nTherefore, summon up your courage and chant for the happiness of yourself and others. That is an expression of deep compassion. When you chant not just for your own happiness but also for that of others, you will attain a life state in which you can gaze down calmly and serenely upon the struggles you are facing.\n\nYou will still have problems, but they won\u2019t overwhelm you. Viewing difficulties as peace and comfort (cf. OTT, 115), as the Daishonin teaches, please continue chanting earnestly for kosen-rufu and courageously taking part in efforts to share Nichiren Buddhism with others. Prayers for kosen-rufu are the prayers of Buddhas and bodhisattvas.\n\nWhen we take on big problems and chant abundantly to find a way to solve them, we can expand and elevate our life state. Before we notice it, our minor, petty problems will all have been resolved. This is the ultimate essence of the Buddhist teaching that the sufferings of earthly desires lead to enlightenment.\n\nChanting about challenges in our life and chanting for kosen-rufu, the aspiration to help all people become happy, are essentially one and indivisible. Both propel us forward.\n\nOur personal victories are actual proof of kosen-rufu. When we chant strongly for the development of the Soka Gakkai, which is advancing kosen-rufu, we forge invincible inner strength and attain the towering life state of champions.\n\nDescribing the Bodhisattvas of the Earth, the Lotus Sutra states: \u201cTheir minds know no fear\u201d (LSOC15, 263). \u201cRejoicing in their hearts\u201d (cf. LSOC15, 255) at all times, they exert themselves freely as though performing a dance.\n\nAwakening to one\u2019s mission as a Bodhisattva of the Earth is to come face-to-face with the innermost essence of one\u2019s life. It is finding the answers to the questions, \u201cWhy was I born?\u201d and \u201cWhat is the purpose of my life?\u201d There is no greater joy, fulfillment, or pride than that which comes from awakening to our eternal mission.\n\nWhile in exile on Sado Island, the Daishonin declared, together with his disciples, that he felt \u201cimmeasurable delight\u201d (WND-1, 386).\n\nManifesting our true identity as Bodhisattvas of the Earth enables our limitless, inner human potential to blossom fully. Ours is a momentous endeavor for peace that aims to fundamentally transform the consciousness of humankind, lifting humanity to unsurpassed heights and uniting people everywhere.\n\nFrom Youth and the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, published in Japanese in September 2012.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Bodhisattvas of the Earth: An innumerable host of bodhisattvas who emerge from beneath the earth and to whom Shakyamuni Buddha entrusts the propagation of the Mystic Law, or the essence of the Lotus Sutra, in the Latter Day of the Law.\n*2Three powerful enemies: Three types of arrogant people who persecute those who propagate the Lotus Sutra in the evil age after Shakyamuni Buddha\u2019s death, described in the concluding verse section of the \u201cEncouraging Devotion\u201d (13th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra.

Somewhere in her mid-30s, her face was gaunt and tired-looking.\n\n\u201cYou have a question, don\u2019t you? Please go ahead,\u201d he encouraged her.\n\nShe stood up listlessly and said: \u201cUm, you see, my husband died from illness. I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to survive from now on.\u201d\nThe woman and her husband had emigrated from Japan to Brazil as contract laborers with their children and had been working the land. Deprived of her husband\u2019s crucial involvement, however, she was unable to keep farming, as she still had several small children to look after.\n\nJust as thoughts of suicide began to cross her mind, she learned about Nichiren Buddhism from a Soka Gakkai member living nearby. She had started her practice only one week before the meeting, and in that short period had found a job at a factory in S\u00e3o Paulo, which also provided her lodging.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d she continued, \u201cwhen I think of living here in a foreign country I know nothing about, struggling to provide for my children, I can\u2019t help feeling anxious. I think I must have awfully heavy karma. And I have no idea what may happen in the future. Just thinking about it is unbearable.\u201d\n\nShin\u2019ichi smiled at her and said: \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry. As long as you continue exerting yourself in faith, you can definitely become happy. That\u2019s what Buddhism is for. Also, your current suffering and misfortune exist so that you may fulfill your own unique and noble mission. Everything will turn to defeat if all you do is worry about your karma and let it make you miserable.\u201d\n\nThe woman gazed at Shin\u2019ichi with a puzzled look. The member who had introduced her to the practice had told her that the reason she had to suffer the loss of her husband was because of negative karma she had accumulated from offenses committed in past lifetimes.\n\nIt is true that Buddhism teaches that one who commits evil deeds against others will receive the negative effects of those actions and live an unhappy life. Were it the entire teaching on karma, however, then people would be doomed to live under a cloud of guilt and pervasive anxiety, not knowing what offenses they might have committed in past lives. It would also mean that people\u2019s destiny was fixed\u2014a concept that could easily rob them of their energy and passion.\n\nThe Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin goes far beyond the framework of superficial causality. It elucidates the most fundamental cause and shows us the way to return to the pure life within that has existed since time without beginning. The means it shows is to awaken to our mission as Bodhisattvas of the Earth*1 and dedicate our lives to the widespread propagation of the Law.\n\nShin\u2019ichi said: \u201cBuddhism teaches the principle of \u2018voluntarily assuming the appropriate karma.\u2019*2 This means that although through Buddhist practice we had accumulated the benefit to be born in favorable circumstances, we purposely chose to be born in the midst of those who are suffering and there propagate the Mystic Law.\n\n\u201cFor example, if someone who had always lived like a queen and enjoyed every luxury were to say, \u2018I became happy as a result of my Buddhist practice,\u2019 no one would bat an eye. But if a person who is sick, whose family is poor, and who is shunned by people because of these things becomes happy through her Buddhist practice and goes on to become a leader in society, this will be splendid proof of the greatness of Nichiren Buddhism. Don\u2019t you agree that this would make others want to start practicing, too?\n\n\u201cBy triumphing over great poverty, a person who has been poor can give hope to others who are struggling with financial hardship. By regaining vitality and good health, someone who has been battling illness can light a flame of courage in the hearts of those in similar straits. By creating a happy and harmonious family, a person who has suffered great anguish over discord in the home can become a model for others plagued by family problems.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, if you\u2014a woman who has been left widowed in a foreign land where she does not speak the language\u2014become happy and raise your children to be fine adults, you\u2019ll be a shining example for all women who have lost their partners. Even those who don\u2019t practice Nichiren Buddhism will admire you and come to seek your advice.\n\n\u201cSo you see, the deeper and greater the suffering, the more magnificently one can show proof of the powerful benefit of Buddhism. You could say that karma is another name for mission.\n\n\u201cI myself am the son of a poor seaweed farmer. I worked by Mr. Toda\u2019s side throughout the bitter trials of his company\u2019s bankruptcy, even though I was frail in health and afflicted with tuberculosis. Because I have experienced hardship and suffering, I can take the lead for kosen-rufu in this way as a representative of the common people.\u201d\n\nShin\u2019ichi continued with even greater emphasis: \u201cEach of you may think you have just happened to come to Brazil because of various personal circumstances. But this is not the case. You have been born as a Bodhisattva of the Earth in order to achieve kosen-rufu in Brazil, to lead the people of this country to happiness and to create an eternal realm of peace and harmony in this land. Indeed, you have been called here by Nichiren Daishonin. When you realize your great mission as a Bodhisattva of the Earth and dedicate yourself to kosen-rufu, the sun that has existed within you since time without beginning will start to shine forth. All offenses you have committed in past lifetimes will vanish like dew, and you will open the way to a wonderful life filled with deep joy and happiness.\u201d\n\nAddressing the woman who had lost her husband, Shin\u2019ichi went on: \u201cViewed from the profound perspective of Buddhism, your suffering is like that portrayed by a brilliant, highly successful stage actress cast in the role of a tragic heroine. When the play is finished, the actress goes home to a life of ease and comfort. Your life is the same. Moreover, the play you are performing on the stage of life\u2019s theater is one that will have a happy ending. There is no need to worry. You will definitely become happy. I say this with absolute certainty. Just as a great actress relishes performing her tragic role, please enact a magnificent drama of human revolution in which you rise triumphantly from the depths of your sorrow.\n\n\u201cAll people are pioneers traveling the frontiers of life. Therefore, it is up to you alone to cultivate and develop your own life. You must wield the hoe of faith, sow the seeds of happiness, and persevere tenaciously. The sweat of your efforts for kosen-rufu will become precious gems of good fortune, forever dignifying your life. Please become the happiest person in Brazil!\u201d\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 1, \u201cPioneers\u201d chapter.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Bodhisattvas of the Earth: An innumerable host of bodhisattvas who emerge from beneath the earth and to whom Shakyamuni Buddha entrusts the propagation of the Mystic Law, or the essence of the Lotus Sutra, in the Latter Day of the Law.\n*2Voluntarily assuming the appropriate karma: This refers to bodhisattvas who, though qualified to receive the pure rewards of Buddhist practice, relinquish them and make a vow to be reborn in an impure world in order to save living beings.

And just as bodhisattvas regard undergoing suffering on behalf of living beings as a source of joy, the Daishonin says he also views experiencing pain and hardship resulting from these present persecutions as a cause for rejoicing, because it will enable him to escape falling into the evil paths in future existences.\n\nThe Daishonin\u2019s assertion that voluntarily assuming the appropriate karma is a source of joy echoes the final lines of \u201cThe Opening of the Eyes,\u201d where he states: \u201cFor what I have done, I have been condemned to exile, but it is a small suffering to undergo in this present life and not one worth lamenting. In future lives I will enjoy immense happiness, a thought that gives me great joy\u201d (WND-1, 287).\n\nThe principle of \u201cvoluntarily assuming the appropriate karma\u201d is the logical conclusion of the Buddhist concept of changing one\u2019s karma. Simply put, it represents a way of life in which we transform karma into mission.\n\nEverything that happens in our lives has meaning. Moreover, the way of life of practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism is to find and discover meaning in all things. Nothing is insignificant. Whatever a person\u2019s karma may be, it definitely has profound meaning. This is not just a matter of outlook. Changing the world starts by changing our fundamental state of mind. This is a key Buddhist principle. A powerful determination to transform even negative karma into mission can dramatically transform the real world. By changing our inner state of mind, we can change any suffering or hardship into a source of joy, regarding it as a means for forging and developing our lives. To turn even sorrow into a source of creativity\u2014that is the way of life of practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nThe Daishonin teaches us this essential path through his own life and actions as the votary of the Lotus Sutra.\n\nTo have a fighting spirit is itself the direct path to happiness. Only through struggles and challenges can we develop inner strength and truly creative lives. Also, by maintaining unwavering faith in the correct teaching of Buddhism no matter what obstacles or hardships arise, we can enter the path of happiness for all eternity. Attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime means securing this path in our daily lives during our present existence.\n\nI therefore believe that practitioners of the correct teaching who strive ceaselessly to spread the Law exemplify the highest expression of humanity taught by the Daishonin based on the Lotus Sutra.\n\nViewed from this perspective, all difficulties become the genuine foundation for our personal development and growth. Practitioners of the correct teaching who endure obstacles with the awareness, \u201c[If devils did not arise], there would be no way of knowing that this is the correct teaching\u201d (WND-1, 501), come to embody the Mystic Law without fail. They attain the expansive state of life in which they can \u201cregard all difficulties as peace and comfort\u201d (cf. OTT, 115), and rejoice at them with the spirit conveyed when Nichiren Daishonin writes, \u201cThe greater the hardships befalling him, the greater the delight he feels, because of his strong faith\u201d (WND-1, 33).\n*\nIn \u201cThe Opening of the Eyes,\u201d the Daishonin says: \u201cWhen iron is heated, if it is not strenuously forged, the impurities in it will not become apparent. Only when it is subjected to the tempering process again and again will the flaws appear. When pressing hemp seeds, if one does not press very hard, one will not get much oil from them\u201d (WND-1, 281\u201382).\n\nIn \u201cLetter from Sado,\u201d the Daishonin also observes: \u201cIt is impossible to fathom one\u2019s karma. Iron, when heated in the flames and pounded, becomes a fine sword. Worthies and sages are tested by abuse\u201d (WND-1, 303). And in \u201cLetter to the Brothers,\u201d he writes: \u201cBoth of you have continued believing in the Lotus Sutra; thus you are now ridding yourselves of your grave offenses from the past. For example, the flaws in iron come to the surface when it is forged\u201d (WND-1, 497).\n\nA life that is forged through efforts to protect the Law drives out the impurities of the negative karma created through slander and endures eternally over the three existences\u2014past, present, and future. From time without beginning, we have repeated the cycle of birth and death. In this lifetime, however, we have had the good fortune to encounter Nichiren Buddhism. Because we practice the correct teaching, denounce slander of the Law, and forge inner strength, we can change our karma and establish the eternally indestructible state of Buddhahood in our lives. This is the attainment of Buddhahood in this lifetime.\n\nPure and committed practice of Nichiren Buddhism entirely changes the meaning of hardships in our lives. We no longer view challenges and trials as negatives to be avoided but as things which, when overcome, bring us closer to our attainment of Buddhahood. Of course, it may not be easy for those in the midst of painful challenges to appreciate this fact. No one wishes to experience hardships. It\u2019s human nature to prefer to avoid them.\n\nBut if we understand the ultimate transformative teaching of the Mystic Law, we can recognize that our hardships have arisen because we are struggling against negative functions, and we can be confident that by overcoming those hardships, we can attain the supreme life state of Buddhahood. With this positive approach, we can live with fundamental strength and resilience in the face of any difficulty.\n\nMembers of the Soka Gakkai understand this ultimate Buddhist truth in the depths of their beings. As proof of this, when our members encounter hardships, they are strong and, above all, positive. That\u2019s because they have already experienced in their own lives the rhythm of fundamental good that accompanies the process of changing karma. Or even if they haven\u2019t yet experienced it themselves, they are constantly in contact with others who have.\n\nThose who strive in faith for kosen-rufu while battling their karma embody the quintessential Buddhist principle of \u201cvoluntarily assuming the appropriate karma.\u201d Our members, comrades from the distant past, summon forth the heart of the lion king\u2014the spirit to bravely take on challenges, never fearing hardships or lamenting painful trials\u2014as they struggle valiantly to transform their karma into their mission and enact the victorious drama of a great human revolution. They possess a truly lofty state of life.\n\nAccordingly, defeat for a practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism lies not in encountering difficulties but rather in not challenging them. Difficulties only truly become our destiny if we run away from them. We must fight as long as we live. We must live and struggle tenaciously to the end. The Daishonin\u2019s philosophy of changing karma, which teaches this important essence of life, is also a revolutionary teaching, in that it represents a radical departure from the way religion has tended to view difficulties.\n\nTo practice Nichiren Buddhism is to live with the unshakable conviction that the most painful and trying times are opportunities for changing karma, for carrying out our human revolution, and that no matter how difficult the situation, we can ultimately, and without fail, transform it into something positive.\n\nAnd it is the Soka Gakkai, an organization directly connected to Nichiren Daishonin, that puts this teaching of changing karma into practice in reality and takes this revolutionary philosophy to the world. With this pride and joy, let us continue our efforts to share Nichiren Buddhism with others.\n\nFrom Lectures on \u201cThe Opening of the Eyes,\u201d published in Japanese in June 2006.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Voluntarily assuming the appropriate karma: This refers to bodhisattvas who, though qualified to receive the pure rewards of Buddhist practice, relinquish them and make a vow to be reborn in an impure world in order to save living beings.

President Ikeda explains that when we persevere in chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we can positively transform all of our struggles and sorrows into happiness, in accord with the Buddhist principle of \u201cchanging poison into medicine.\u201d\n\nWe live in the saha world\u2014a world requiring forbearance and endurance.*1 There are always things in this life that we have to endure and persevere through. Nichiren Buddhism and faith as taught and practiced in the Soka Gakkai enable us to calmly overcome every form of sadness, suffering, and karma, and attain a state of supreme happiness.\n\nLife is filled with all sorts of struggles and sufferings\u2014our own illness or that of loved ones, death, financial hardship, relationship problems, the frustration of not being able to have what we want, and the list goes on. Problems are unavoidable. They are an inescapable reality of life.\n\nPracticing Nichiren Buddhism, and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, enables us to positively transform all of those sufferings, in accord with the principle of \u201cchanging poison into medicine.\u201d*2 The poison of suffering is transformed into the medicine of joy.\n\nBecause of the principle that \u201cearthly desires lead to enlightenment,\u201d suffering becomes enlightenment and happiness. The greater our problem or sorrow, the greater the happiness we can change it into. This is the power of daimoku. That\u2019s why those who chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo do not fear anything. There is no need to.\n\nYoung saplings are buffeted easily by the slightest wind, but when they grow into sturdy, tall trees, they stand unshaken by even the fiercest storm. People, similarly, when their life force is weak, are easily disturbed by the \u201cwinds\u201d of even minor problems or worries.\n\nLiving in this saha world, it is impossible to stop the winds of suffering from blowing. Our only alternative is to become strong. When we develop dauntless fortitude, like mighty trees, we will be untroubled by even the most powerful gales. In fact, we can even find them exhilarating. The aim of our Buddhist practice is to carry out our human revolution so that we can lead such lives and develop such inner strength.\n\nThough we may not notice it, a tree grows every day. In the same indiscernible way, our daimoku nurtures our growth day after day into people of unshakable strength who abound with good fortune. After 10 or 20 years of practicing with the Soka Gakkai, the great benefit we have accumulated becomes clearly visible.\n\nThe Mystic Law is the supreme treasure in the universe. Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo allows us to accumulate that treasure in our lives on a daily basis. At the same time, it functions to cleanse our lives of negative karma from past actions, just as pure water flushes out dirty water.\n\nThe process of purification takes time. At the start, we have to struggle with the slightly dirty water of our negative karma. The power of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, however, lightens this task, too. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we continue chanting. When our lives are eventually purified, everything will start improving dramatically.\n\nWe will definitely attain an indestructible state of absolute happiness brimming with good fortune and benefit. We will then enjoy whatever happens. We will be content, even if we do not have fame or fortune. Each moment will be deeply satisfying. Joy will fill our hearts, and everything will appear beautiful to us. We will be able to swiftly discern right and wrong, the true essence of all things. Whatever our own circumstances, we will be able to give thought to the welfare of others. That\u2019s the kind of people we will become.\n\nThe way to happiness is not complicated. Those who chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo consistently in the realm of kosen-rufu triumph in the end. They are certain to attain a state of absolute happiness\u2014in other words, the life state of Buddhahood. If you remember this single important point, your life will always be solid and secure.\n\nFrom remarks on his first visit to the SGI-Brazil Auditorium in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, March 3, 1993.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1In The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, Nichiren Daishonin says: \u201cSaha means a world in which one must exercise forbearance and learn to endure\u201d (OTT, 169).\n*2Changing poison into medicine: The principle that earthly desires and suffering can be transformed into benefit and enlightenment by virtue of the power of the Mystic Law.

In one Buddhist scripture, he states that it was all for the sake of future practitioners of Buddhism.\n\nIn other words, Shakyamuni says, he called forth such hardships as expedient means, so that when others practice Buddhism and face unpleasant criticism, feeling they want to quit their Buddhist practice, they will remind themselves that even he was unjustly maligned, and encourage themselves to press on with fresh resolve.\n\nTo personally undergo difficulties in order to prevent practitioners in future ages from giving up is an expression of the Buddha\u2019s compassion.\n\nIn one respect, all the challenges and hardships we of the Soka Gakkai experience today are for the sake of the eternal future of kosen-rufu. They will serve as a reference point for distant ages hence, a model and blueprint of kosen-rufu for future generations.\n\nNo doubt our fellow members of ages to come will look back and say, \u201cSo that\u2019s what happened then. Such difficulties arising is a timeless and unchanging pattern, so we mustn\u2019t allow ourselves to be defeated when we encounter them. We can overcome everything through our Buddhist practice. Let\u2019s fight on!\u201d The record of our struggles will be a source from which they can draw limitless courage, hope, and inspiration.\n\nIn that sense, our struggles with the many hardships that arise in the course of our Buddhist practice are part of a grand drama, a towering epic, that we are performing on the stage of this brief lifetime to achieve magnificent and everlasting victories in our lives and in kosen-rufu.\n\nBy extension, the personal problems we face even as leaders\u2014be it illness or some family misfortune\u2014can also serve as sources of tremendous encouragement to others who are suffering from similar problems, spurring them to do their best and remain undefeated.\n\nBased on the Daishonin\u2019s writings, we can be assured that courageous individuals who challenge difficulties and energetically spread the Mystic Law will definitely enjoy the protection of all Buddhas. It is the heart of Shakyamuni and the compassionate spirit of Nichiren Daishonin to resolutely safeguard all dedicated practitioners of Buddhism who are striving for kosen-rufu.\n\nPlease be confident that your strong prayers will activate the power of the world of Buddhahood inherent in the universe itself, and further resonate with the workings of the worlds of bodhisattvas, voice-hearers, and cause-awakened ones*1 as well as the protective functions of all heavenly deities, enabling you to open the way to a life of great victory and complete fulfillment.\n\nFrom a speech at a Chubu Region general meeting, Aichi, January 29, 1989.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1The worlds of voice-hearers, cause-awakened ones, and bodhisattvas together with the world of Buddhahood form the four noble worlds\u2014the highest four of the Ten Worlds.

Praising her, he says that the Soka Gakkai is a gathering of bodhisattvas who have stood up to shoulder their own unique, noble missions.\n\nThroughout Japan and the world, our women\u2019s division members\u2014the mothers of kosen-rufu\u2014are leading their lives with confidence, determination, and fortitude.\n\nOne such woman is an SGI-USA pioneer member. After marrying an American in Japan, she went to the United States with her husband and their young son in 1966. Her husband was in the military and was sent to Vietnam. Left alone in the United States with her son and not yet fluent in English, she performed hard menial work to earn extra money to make ends meet. Even after her husband\u2019s return from the war, the family\u2019s financial difficulties continued.\n\nEventually the couple had another son, but he was born with serious disabilities. Doctors said he would never walk or talk and advised them to commit him to an institution, but the mother fiercely resolved to raise her son herself.\n\nTo survive, she sold virtually everything she had\u2014her clothes, including the precious silk kimono she had brought from Japan, her pots and pans\u2014but the family still didn\u2019t have enough to live on. Why did she experience all this suffering? The harsh waves of karma seemed to pound her relentlessly.\n\nHaving been an active district-level leader in the Soka Gakkai in Japan, however, this member squarely faced the challenges before her; she refused to run away from reality. She held down a job during the day and exerted herself tirelessly on the front lines of kosen-rufu in the evenings.\n\nOne evening, she was seated before the Gohonzon as usual. As she was chanting in a clear, resounding voice, the hour grew late; suddenly, she felt as if a brilliant light illuminated her mind: \u201cI am a proud member of the Soka Gakkai. I have the Gohonzon. I have nothing to fear. There is no way that I won\u2019t become happy.\u201d Tears of unsurpassed joy fell from her eyes.\n\nThe sun of happiness rises brightly in the lives of those who valiantly take on, here and now, the challenges presented by their circumstances, their lives, and the struggle for kosen-rufu.\n\nIn a letter addressed to a woman follower, the Daishonin writes: \u201cThere is nothing to lament when we consider that we will surely become Buddhas\u201d (WND-1, 657).\n\nThe Lotus Sutra teaches the profound principle of \u201cvoluntarily assuming the appropriate karma.\u201d*1 According to the sutra, bodhisattvas, of their own free will, seek to be reborn into an evil age because they empathize with those who are suffering and wish to lead them to happiness.\n\nEach of us, no matter what hardships we may face or what circumstances we may find ourselves in, has a noble mission that only we can fulfill. When we deeply recognize this, everything changes.\n\nWe have been born in this world, at this time, to accomplish the great vow we made in the remote past. Our karma is our mission; it is the stage upon which we play out our magnificent drama of transforming adversity into triumph. No matter how difficult or challenging the reality of our lives may be, there is no other separate place where we can achieve happiness.\n\nThis pioneer member\u2019s elder son grew up watching his mother\u2019s courageous example. He went on to graduate as a top student of his class at Yale University.\n\nHer younger son, whom doctors had said would never walk, can even run now, and he also participates in SGI meetings.\n\nThis January [2004], this wonderful woman, at 79, declared proudly: \u201cI don\u2019t feel old at all. For kosen-rufu, I will continue speaking out to defend the truth and justice of the Soka Gakkai as long as I live!\u201d She is a woman who has triumphed brilliantly.\n\nThe resounding music of our women\u2019s division members\u2019 unceasing efforts fills the air day after day in every community and locale. Truly, they are the driving force of kosen-rufu, and no praise, no matter how eloquent, can fully do them justice. Every day, my wife and I pray earnestly and sincerely that all of these admirable women who work for and devote themselves to kosen-rufu will enjoy lives of boundless happiness and fulfillment.\n\nMothers of kosen-rufu, who shine like the sun, let your joyous voices ring out even more powerfully with courage, truth, and victory!\n\nI will pray all my life for your wonderful development, and that your strong, happy, and wise voices may resound ever more vibrantly.\n\nFrom an essay series \u201cThe Light of the Century of Humanity,\u201d published in Japanese in theSeikyo Shimbun, January 19, 2004.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Voluntarily assuming the appropriate karma: This refers to bodhisattvas who, though qualified to receive the pure rewards of Buddhist practice, relinquish them and make a vow to be reborn in an impure world in order to save living beings.

That\u2019s why we specifically chose to be born as ordinary people, experiencing sickness and poverty, so that we could widely spread Buddhism in society. . . . Life is like playing a part in a drama.\u201d He often gave guidance in this vein.\n\nHe also said: \u201cI lost my wife and also my daughter. My businesses failed. Because I have known such sufferings, I was able to become the president of the Soka Gakkai.\u201d\n\nThose who haven\u2019t experienced hardships and sufferings can\u2019t be expected to understand others\u2019 feelings. Only those who have gone through painful struggles and trials can truly help others.\n\nTo simply regard all our sufferings as karma is passive and defeatist. Instead, we should view them as sufferings we have voluntarily taken on as part of our mission, and which we have vowed to overcome through our Buddhist practice.\n\nThe principle of \u201cvoluntarily assuming the appropriate karma\u201d*1 teaches this fundamental transformation of attitude, or mind-set. We can definitely transform our karma into our mission. Since all our problems and struggles are expressions of our own vow, there is no way that we will not be able to surmount them.\n\nMahatma Gandhi, leader of the Indian independence movement, declared: \u201cIf I have to be reborn I should be reborn an untouchable, so that I may share their sorrows, sufferings, and the affronts leveled against them, in order that I may endeavor to free myself and them from that miserable condition.\u201d*2\n\nThis attitude is an expression of the teaching of \u201cvoluntarily assuming the appropriate karma\u201d\u2014of compassion, of sharing our lives with others.\n\nWe [as Bodhisattvas of the Earth*3] are born among those suffering the most.\n\nThe Buddha resides among those who are suffering the most.\n\nBuddhism exists to enable those suffering the most to attain the greatest happiness.\n\nFrom The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra, vol. 2, published in Japanese in November 1996.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Voluntarily assuming the appropriate karma: This refers to bodhisattvas who, though qualified to receive the pure rewards of Buddhist practice, relinquish them and make a vow to be reborn in an impure world in order to save living beings.

He voices confidence that the philosophy of human revolution, which enables us to turn karma into mission, offers a new guide for humanity in the third millennium.\n\nThe main theme of both The Human Revolution and The New Human Revolution is: \u201cA great human revolution in just a single individual will help achieve a change in the destiny of a nation and, further, will enable a change in the destiny of all humankind.\u201d\n\nHow, then, do we actually go about changing our destiny or karma?\n\nThe profound awakening that Josei Toda experienced while in prison holds the answer to this question. Wishing to grasp the truth of the Lotus Sutra, he carefully read its passages again and again and chanted Nam-myoho-renge-kyo each day in his prison cell. In the course of doing so, he eventually awakened to the fact that he had been present along with Nichiren Daishonin at the Ceremony in the Air depicted in the Lotus Sutra and was a Bodhisattva of the Earth entrusted with propagating the Law in the Latter Day. With inexpressible joy at this realization, he vowed to dedicate his life to kosen-rufu.\n\nThe Daishonin writes: \u201cIf you are of the same mind as Nichiren, you must be a Bodhisattva of the Earth\u201d (WND-1, 385). As this indicates, we, who devote ourselves to kosen-rufu just as the Daishonin teaches, are irrefutably Bodhisattvas of the Earth.*1 Why is it, then, that we\u2014noble bodhisattvas tasked with the solemn undertaking of kosen-rufu\u2014have been born with karma that causes us various kinds of suffering?\n\nThe \u201cTeacher of the Law\u201d (10th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra states: \u201cThese people voluntarily relinquish the reward due them for their pure deeds and, in the time after I have passed into extinction, because they pity living beings, they are born in this evil world so they may broadly expound this sutra\u201d (LSOC10, 200). The Great Teacher Miao-lo of China identifies this passage as articulating the principle of \u201cvoluntarily assuming the appropriate karma.\u201d*2\n\nJust as this principle explains, we have chosen, in accord with our vow as bodhisattvas, to be born into the evil age of the Latter Day of the Law with all sorts of destinies, or karma\u2014illness, financial hardship, family discord, loneliness, low self-esteem, and the list goes on\u2014to help guide others to enlightenment. But by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, striving in our Buddhist practice for ourselves and others, and dedicating our lives to kosen-rufu, our vibrant life force as Bodhisattvas of the Earth and the expansive life state of Buddhahood well forth within us. Our lives will brim with the wisdom, courage, strength, hope, and joy to overcome every hardship and daunting obstacle that arises. As we bravely triumph over the onslaughts of karma, we demonstrate the validity of the teachings of Nichiren Buddhism and the tremendous benefit of our Buddhist practice, and further advance kosen-rufu. In fact, we have willingly taken on these hardships and sufferings in order to do just that.\n\nKarma and mission are two sides of the same coin, and our karma directly becomes our unique and noble mission. That is why, when we dedicate our lives to kosen-rufu, there is no destiny that we cannot change.\n\nWe are all Bodhisattvas of the Earth and have a right to become happy. We are the lead players and stars in a glorious drama performed on the grand stage of life\u2014a drama of changing the icy winds of winter into the warm sunshine of spring, transforming suffering into joy.\n\nThe New Human Revolution unfolds as a story of changing karma or destiny into mission. The quintessential teaching of Nichiren Buddhism does not view life and its phenomena as fixed or static, but elucidates life\u2019s dynamism, in which everything is changing and open to change, as is seen in such principles as \u201cearthly desires are enlightenment,\u201d \u201cthe sufferings of birth and death are nirvana,\u201d and \u201cchanging poison into medicine.\u201d*3 It also perceives the potential for Buddhahood in the depths of the life of each suffering human being, and teaches the way to awaken and manifest that life state\u2014in other words, the supreme positive potential, creativity, and autonomy of human beings. This process of changing our lives, or inner transformation, we call human revolution.\n\nHuman beings are the builders and shapers of the societies, nations, and the world in which they live. Hatred and trust, disdain and respect, war and peace\u2014all are the products of the human heart and mind. As a result, without human revolution, there can be no true personal happiness, social prosperity, or lasting world peace. Without this crucial element, any attempts to effect enduring change will be in vain. The philosophy of human revolution based on the principles of Nichiren Buddhism is certain to become a new guide for humanity as we set forth into this third millennium.\n\nThe Russian writer Leo Tolstoy observed to the effect that an immortal spirit likewise requires immortal deeds.*4 It is my sincere hope that Soka Gakkai members will make the completion of The New Human Revolution a fresh starting point and stand up as \u201cShin\u2019ichi Yamamotos\u201d to work for the happiness of others. I pray that, through their tireless, tenacious efforts, they will create their own brilliant history of human revolution.\n\nAs long as suffering and misery exist anywhere on our planet, we must continue to weave with rich color and bold creativity the magnificent tapestry of human victory that is kosen-rufu. That is why our mentor-disciple journey to realize the great vow for kosen-rufu will continue forever.\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, volume 30, \u201cAfterword.\u201d\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Bodhisattvas of the Earth: An innumerable host of bodhisattvas who emerge from beneath the earth and to whom Shakyamuni Buddha entrusts the propagation of the Mystic Law, or the essence of the Lotus Sutra, in the Latter Day of the Law.\n*2Voluntarily assuming the appropriate karma: This refers to bodhisattvas who, though qualified to receive the pure rewards of Buddhist practice, relinquish them and make a vow to be reborn in an impure world in order to save living beings.

(An excerpt from the 2003 speech in which he presented these guidelines appears in the Supplementary Reading section at the end of this chapter.)\n\nThis chapter focuses on the first of these five guidelines, \u201cFaith for a harmonious family.\u201d\n\nStriving to create a harmonious family starts with our own inner transformation, our human revolution. Those around us are indeed the mirror in which our human revolution is reflected. When we change, others change, our environment changes, and the world changes. One of the most important and fundamental arenas where this drama of human revolution takes place is our family.\n\nIn this selection, President Ikeda discusses the importance of striving in faith with the goal of creating happy and harmonious families. He states that one person\u2019s human revolution is certain to lead to a positive transformation in their family.\n\n\u201cFaith for a harmonious family\u201d is an eternal guideline articulated by second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda.\n\nA bright, positive family joined by ties of trust and affection is a reflection of a pure and rich spirit. It is also both the first step and ultimate goal in our efforts to build a world of peace and happiness.\n\nOver the years, countless Soka Gakkai members have transformed bleak, negative family situations into bright, happy ones. This is the proud personal history of human revolution achieved by each individual, which constitutes the strong, deep foundation of the Soka Gakkai\u2019s history.\n\nThe example of Soka Gakkai members creating harmonious families is both a living model for all people and, I believe, a shining symbol of the future of Japan and the world.\n\nOur aim is to actualize an ideal society where personal happiness and social prosperity go hand in hand, which of course includes harmonious families. The key to building a sound and healthy family life is for each person, based on the Mystic Law, to make efforts to establish a strong and secure life for themselves while also contributing to the prosperity of society and world peace.\n\nNot all who take faith in Nichiren Buddhism have their whole families start practicing with them. Sometimes, people encounter intense opposition from family members. But such opposition is just a test of faith, and is certain to be resolved once one has carried out one\u2019s human revolution and developed into a truly fine member of society and of one\u2019s family.\n\nThe \u201cFormer Affairs of King Wonderful Adornment\u201d (27th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra relates the story of the past lives of Bodhisattva Medicine King and Bodhisattva Medicine Superior as the two brothers Pure Storehouse and Pure Eye. These brothers worked together with their mother, Pure Virtue, to persuade their father, King Wonderful Adornment, to take faith in Buddhism. To achieve this, Pure Storehouse and Pure Eye displayed various supernatural powers. This is a metaphor for demonstrating the power of the Buddha and the power of the Law\u2014which, expressed in modern terms, is nothing other than showing proof of one\u2019s human revolution.\n\nI believe that any revolution that is genuine\u2014that truly serves the needs of the people\u2014will also clearly manifest itself in the family. Such a family-based revolution is the most fundamental and lasting kind of revolution; it will create an enduring groundswell and become the tide of the times that no one can hold back.\n\nFrom an editorial titled \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family,\u201d published in Japanese in the Daibyakurenge, April 1968.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 12: Transforming Karma into Mission [12.9]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 13: \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family\u201d [13.2]"}, {"title": "chapter-13-2.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 13: \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family\u201d [13.2]\n13.2 The Miraculous Words \u201cThank You\u201d\nBeing able to have deep appreciation for everyone around us is proof of our human revolution. Appreciation for others accelerates that inner transformation.\n\n\u201cThank you\u201d is a miraculous expression. It energizes us when we say it to others, and encourages us when we hear it said to us. I am constantly saying \u201cThank you\u201d from morning to night, every day. When I travel abroad, it is the one expression from the language of the country I am visiting that I always learn and use. Whether it is \u201cThank you,\u201d \u201cMerci,\u201d \u201cDanke,\u201d \u201cGracias,\u201d \u201cSpasiba,\u201d or \u201cXie xie,\u201d I put my whole heart into expressing my appreciation, looking the other person in the eye as I do so.\n\nWhen we speak or hear the words \u201cthank you,\u201d the armor falls from our hearts and we communicate on a deep level. \u201cThank you\u201d is the essence of nonviolence. It contains respect for the other person, humility, and a profound affirmation of life. It possesses a positive, upbeat optimism. It has strength. A person who can sincerely say thank you has a healthy, vital spirit; each time we say those words, our hearts sparkle and life force wells up within us.\n\nHaving gratitude and appreciation for the countless people and things that support our lives\u2014that awareness, that feeling, that joy\u2014will invite even greater happiness. Rather than being thankful because we are happy, being thankful itself will make us happy. Also, chanting with gratitude puts us in rhythm with the universe, turning our lives in a positive direction.\n\nWhen we cannot say thank you, our personal growth has stopped. When we are growing, we can see how wonderful others are, too. When we stop growing, all we see are other people\u2019s faults.\n\nAt home, instead of trying to change your partner or your children to your liking, why not start with a simple \u201cthank you\u201d?\n\nThere is a women\u2019s division member who suffered from dementia in her later years, and she was unable to remember even the names of her family members. But when the doctor asked her what was the happiest moment in her life, she immediately responded: \u201cWhen my daughter was born. I was so happy!\u201d Hearing this, tears welled up in the eyes of her daughter, who was standing nearby. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you, mother. That was all I needed to hear.\u201d\n\nThe daughter reflected on how she was always scolding her own son. \u201cYes,\u201d she thought, \u201chow happy I was when he was born!\u201d Yet, over the years, driven by some mental image of an ideal child, she had tried to mold her son to fit that form, thinking only of where he didn\u2019t measure up to the ideal and dwelling on his shortcomings in one respect or another. Still, in spite of how demanding she was, her son tried his best to live up to her expectations. He was kind to her. As these thoughts came to her, she was overcome with gratitude toward him. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m just happy you are alive and well. I\u2019m just happy you\u2019re here beside me. Thank you.\u201d\n\nShe saw her son with fresh eyes, and suddenly she had so many reasons to be grateful and happy. After all, though it was hard getting her son out of bed in the mornings, he would eventually get up, even if it was sometimes at the last minute. That, in itself, was an amazing thing. He may have been a little picky about his food, and he may not have been at the top of his class, but she was just grateful he went to school and wore a bright smile each day.\n\nShe was grateful for everything, even when nothing special happened. She was grateful for each day that passed with her family safe and well. She realized that taking so much for granted had been a symptom of a deep and pervading arrogance on her part.\n\nSimilarly, there are people who, when diagnosed with a serious illness, realize for the first time just how much they have taken their health for granted and never appreciated all that they had.\n\nI hope that, every once in a while, you will look your partner in the eye and say thank you. Instead of eating dinner together in silence, take the time to express your appreciation. It may seem a bit embarrassing at first, but try it: you\u2019ll see how it changes your life.\n\nFrom an essay series \u201cLife Is Wonderful,\u201d published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, May 29, 2004.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 13: \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family\u201d [13.1]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 13: \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family\u201d [13.3]"}, {"title": "chapter-13-3.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 13: \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family\u201d [13.3]\n13.3 Showing Appreciation for Our Parents Is the Heart of Buddhism\nIn encouraging a young women\u2019s division member who was concerned about her father not practicing Nichiren Buddhism, President Ikeda said this was an expression of her father\u2019s compassion, that her father was teaching her to be compassionate. In the following excerpt, President Ikeda warmly encourages members in similar situations, calling on them to be openhearted and accepting, and to respect their parents and treat them well.\n\nI\u2019m sure that many of you have parents or other family members who are not practicing Nichiren Buddhism, but there is no reason to feel anxious or worried on that account. When you as an individual stand up with genuine faith, you can lead all of your loved ones to the path of eternal happiness. Such is the limitless power of the Mystic Law.\n\nWhen the sun rises, it illuminates everything on earth. When a single lighthouse shines out to sea at night, countless vessels can navigate safely. When a family has one person who acts as a strong pillar, all of its members can lead secure, tranquil lives.\n\nYou are suns that shine and illuminate others with happiness. You are lighthouses that guide people to attaining Buddhahood. You are the solid central pillars of good fortune and benefit that bring happiness to your families. Those who have formed a connection with Buddhism will eventually come to accept and practice it. Please live your lives in a cheerful, positive manner, embracing everyone around you with an open heart and broad-minded humanity.\n\nIn a letter to the young Nanjo Tokimitsu, Nichiren Daishonin says that if one wishes to give something nice to one\u2019s parents, but has nothing at hand, then one should simply give them a smile two or three times a day (cf. WND-2, 636).\n\nParents are delighted by their children\u2019s smiles, which brighten their hearts like rays of sunshine. Showing appreciation for one\u2019s parents is the heart of Buddhism. Nothing makes parents happier than pleasant, loving interactions with their children that fill them with pride and joy at having raised such fine human beings. They\u2019ll even be ready to listen to whatever such children have to say.\n\nIf every time you see your parents, you insist they start practicing Buddhism, saying they will suffer unless they do, you\u2019ll only make them unhappy and resentful.\n\nIt\u2019s only natural that you will sincerely chant for your parents to attain Buddhahood, but I also hope that your conduct toward them will always be pervaded by wisdom, warmth, and common sense. Showing how you have grown as a human being is the best way to communicate the truth of Buddhism to those around you. Doing so will increase both your own and your family\u2019s good fortune and benefit.\n\nFrom a speech at an SGI general meeting, France, June 16, 1991.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 13: \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family\u201d [13.2]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 13: \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family\u201d [13.4]"}, {"title": "chapter-13-4.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 13: \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family\u201d [13.4]\n13.4 Advice on Raising and Educating Children in the Home\nIn a speech celebrating the establishment of the SGI-USA\u2019s Future Division, President Ikeda offers six points of advice for raising and educating children in the home.\n\nI would now like to turn to the subject of how we raise and educate children in the home, sharing a few points as they come to mind. I have observed many families and experienced many situations, and what I offer are my own conclusions. I will be most happy if they are of some use to you.\n\n(1) Let Children Focus on Their Studies\n\nFirst, the members of the Future Division should make study their first priority. It goes without saying that faith is important, but faith is something we practice throughout our entire lives. There is a certain age and period in life when one should study. If one doesn\u2019t work hard during that time, one may fail to acquire important knowledge and skills, and come to regret it deeply later.\n\nFaith manifests itself in daily life. For the members of the Future Division, faith is expressed in their studies. During this period, to devote themselves to study represents an important part of their Buddhist practice. If they neglect their studies because they are busy doing gongyo or attending meetings, it certainly cannot be called the correct way of faith.\n\nEven if sometimes your children can\u2019t do gongyo, there is no reason for you as parents to become overly concerned or agitated about this. There are occasions when simply chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo three times is quite sufficient.\n\nThe main thing is that they continue practicing. It\u2019s important to foster in children the spirit to stay connected to the Gohonzon and the Soka Gakkai throughout their lives. It\u2019s fine if they progress in their faith and practice bit by bit. Parents should be broad-minded on this matter. They might even sometimes reassure a child who is busy with studying by saying: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll do gongyo for you today.\u201d\n\nIn fact, putting too much pressure on children to practice may only alienate them from faith. I hope you will lead them wisely so that they can grow and develop freely and naturally in the best possible way.\n\n(2) Take Time for Parent-Child Communication\n\nNext, I would like to request that, no matter how busy you may be, you make an effort to get together and talk with your children. The length of time is not important. What matters is that you use wisdom.\n\nEven if it\u2019s only a brief encounter, give your children a hug when you see them. Bond with them, talk with them, and try to make time to listen to what they have to say. As long as you have love and compassion, you will find the wisdom to make it work.\n\nFaith manifests itself as wisdom. The purpose of our faith is to become wise so that we can live our lives wisely.\n\nEven if we talk about our commitment to helping others, our words remain empty if we cannot genuinely communicate with our own children or build strong and happy families.\n\nThe good fortune that accrues to parents who apply themselves diligently to Soka Gakkai activities will protect their children without fail. Please have that conviction. Nevertheless, you must still make positive efforts to open and sustain dialogue with your children, not allowing yourselves to neglect them, claiming that you\u2019re too busy, or that it can\u2019t be helped, or telling yourselves that somehow things will work out on their own. That is what it takes to be responsible, compassionate parents.\n\nIt\u2019s not a question of conforming to any particular style. It is the heart that is important. Are your hearts connected? Some families may always be together physically, but their hearts estranged from one another. Other families may only be together for brief periods but manage to enjoy rich and lively heart-to-heart communication at such times. Families who share bonds of closeness as a result of consistent efforts to stay connected feel comfortable and at ease with one another, no matter where they are or what they are doing.\n\nI ask that parents come up with creative ways for their families to stay connected and continually strive to improve themselves together with their children.\n\n(3) Avoid Arguing in Front of Your Children\n\nAlways remember that a child is a person, an individual with a distinct personality. Children can at times be even more keenly perceptive than adults. That is why we must be careful how we behave in front of them. For example, parents should avoid arguing in front of their children. If you must argue, do it where they cannot see you! Children are saddened when their parents fight. They go off to school with heavy hearts, and they will not forget the incident for a long time.\n\nAccording to one psychologist, when children see their parents fighting, they are often shaken to the very core, experiencing fear and anxiety as if the ground has given way beneath them. Tall trees grow from secure and solid ground. Please give your children a home where they can enjoy tranquility and peace of mind.\n\n(4) Refrain from Scolding Your Child at the Same Time\n\nSons tend to rebel when scolded by their fathers, while they are more likely to listen to their mothers\u2019 scolding. The worst thing is for the father and the mother to gang up and scold the child together. This leaves the child with no one to turn to.\n\nFathers tend to have a soft spot for daughters and, consequently, are too easy on them. Mothers and daughters, meanwhile, often share a deep, natural understanding as women. That is why it is often better for mothers to talk with their daughters as well.\n\nRegarding parents scolding their children, President Toda said: \u201cWhen fathers get angry, they alienate their children. But even when mothers get angry, their children stay close to them.\u201d\n\nThis wisdom is based on an understanding of human behavior and psychology.\n\nOf course, there are always differences among cultures and among individual households, but I hope these observations may provide some helpful insight for you.\n\n(5) Be Fair and Don\u2019t Compare One Child with Another\n\nParents must be fair. They must never favor one child over another for being smarter, better-looking, or more accomplished in anyway. A parent\u2019s single thoughtless remark can often deeply wound a child and instill a sense of inferiority. How much worse the damage will be if children are always being compared with their siblings and treated unfairly! They will be starved for affection and feel lonely and hurt. Under such circumstances, they cannot grow and develop in a healthy fashion.\n\nWatch over your children with warm affection and encourage them. Discover and praise their strengths, building their confidence. Become their unfailing allies, support them, shower them with love and believe utterly in their potential. Respect each child\u2019s individuality. That\u2019s a parent\u2019s role.\n\nOur society and our schools may operate on the unfeeling principle of competition, judging and selecting people by their abilities and appearance. That is all the more reason why it is important for the family to be a place of fairness and equality, where everyone is valued as a unique and irreplaceable individual.\n\n(6) Share Your Dedication to Faith with Your Children\n\nUltimately, to raise children to become fine adults, parents need to be firmly in tune with their children and grow together with them, moving forward as one.\n\nAs Soka Gakkai members, we are dedicating ourselves for the sake of the Law and the happiness of others. Ours is not a self-centered existence. As a result, we may be busier than most and perhaps not have as much time to relax with our families as we would like. Nevertheless, we continue to devote ourselves to others.\n\nOurs is the noblest way of life. We must make sure our children can understand and respect our beliefs, our way of life, and our dedication. It is a mistake to assume that they will somehow come to know we love them or to understand our commitment to kosen-rufu on their own, without us having to say anything. We must make conscious efforts to verbalize and communicate our thoughts and feelings to them\u2014and to do so wisely, in a relaxed way, without pressuring them. Finding the wisdom for this task is an expression of our faith.\n\nI have heard that the breakdown of the family has become a major social problem in the United States. The same tendencies are emerging in Japan. In light of this situation, and also prompted by the announcement of the upcoming establishment of the SGI-USA Future Division, I have shared with you several points that come to mind on this topic.\n\n\u201cFaith for a harmonious family\u201d is one of the eternal guidelines of the Soka Gakkai. I am visualizing the day when the youngsters nurtured by your warm and delightful families grow to become outstanding leaders of the 21st century who will illuminate America and the entire world like a brilliant constellation of stars or the dazzling sun. With that thought, I conclude my speech.\n\nFrom a speech at an SGI representatives conference, U.S.A., February 3, 1993.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 13: \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family\u201d [13.3]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 13: \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family\u201d [13.5]"}, {"title": "chapter-13-5.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 13: \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family\u201d [13.5]\n13.5 Accepting Others for Who They Are\nPresident Ikeda explains that good parenting begins with recognizing and accepting children for who they are.\n\nMany children today say that they don\u2019t feel as if they belong anywhere, that there is nowhere they can feel completely accepted. This may be because many families have adopted the value criteria of schools and businesses, always measuring and ranking children against some standard of performance or excellence.\n\nChildren feel that the harder they try to please their parents, the more their parents expect of them. When they ask why such demands are being made on them, their parents say: \u201cIt\u2019s for your own future,\u201d or \u201cI demand so much of you because I love you.\u201d This can lead to children coming to see themselves as worthless and falling into despair because they can\u2019t live up to their parents\u2019 love and expectations. Such feelings of inadequacy or even self-loathing build up and cause children great suffering.\n\nThe cheerless view of life presented by parents who can only express their love for their children by scolding them to \u201cstudy harder\u201d may itself be the root cause of children\u2019s anger and frustration.\n\nThe first step is to recognize, accept, and embrace your children for who they are. Don\u2019t force your idealized image of the perfect child on them. Make sure they know you love them for who they are, not because they are well-behaved or get good grades in school. Give them all the love they need, and assure them that whatever they may do, you are their greatest friend and ally.\n\nThat\u2019s the way to enable children to learn to love themselves, and children who love themselves can nurture and develop themselves.\n\nIf children can learn to think for themselves, questioning why they are doing something, and motivate themselves to contribute to the happiness and welfare of others, they will be unstoppable. This will be all the more so if parents set such an example through their own behavior and actions.\n\nFrom an essay series \u201cLooking toward the Future\u2014Dialogues with Leaders from Various Fields,\u201d\n\npublished in Japanese in the Daibyakurenge, March 2000.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 13: \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family\u201d [13.4]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 13: \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family\u201d [13.6]"}, {"title": "chapter-13-6.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 13: \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family\u201d [13.6]\n13.6 A Partnership of Deepening Love and Respect\nIn this selection, President Ikeda replies to a question about divorce and then goes on to share important insights for developing a partnership of deepening love and respect.\n\n\u2014Should couples in troubled marriages refrain from divorce and instead stay together to work at changing their karma?\n\nThis is an individual matter. No one else has the right to say that someone should or should not get divorced. Nor can anyone say a person has no faith because he or she is divorced. Divorce is a matter of personal choice.\n\nWhether or not a couple gets divorced, the important thing is that they become happy in the end, that they do their human revolution. To be happy, whether or not one is married; to be happy, whether or not one has children\u2014that is what faith is about, because happiness is something that exists within our own hearts.\n\nWe are born alone and we die alone. The purpose of this lifetime is to transform our own selves. That is why we need to do our best, bringing those around us to function as good friends or influences and viewing everything we do as part of our Buddhist practice.\n\nSomeone once asked President Toda this question: \u201cThings are not going very well between my partner and me. Should I try to stick it out? Or do you think I ought to get a divorce?\u201d\n\nHe replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to tell you what to do about your marriage. I can neither tell you not to get divorced nor to get divorced. The only thing I can say is that unless you break through the karma that led to you having such a problematic relationship, then, even if you separate, you are bound to experience the same kind of suffering in the future. And if you\u2019re going to have to go through the same suffering anyway, then perhaps it\u2019s not too late to do something about it in your present marriage.\u201d*1\n\nIt\u2019s ideal if the parents of a child get along well. But if they don\u2019t and end up divorcing, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the child will turn out badly. There are many cases where children grow into fine, upstanding people precisely because of such hardships.\n\nUltimately, you have to make your own decision based on reflecting deeply on your life, seeing yourself for who you are, and striving tirelessly to accomplish your human revolution in the place you are now. As long as you have such strong faith, you will definitely become happy in the end. No matter what happens, as long as you have the faith to continue advancing toward the achievement of kosen-rufu without giving up your practice, you will be victorious in the end. That\u2019s all you need to understand.\n\nIf people do get divorced, then, rather than brooding over the past, it would be wonderful if they could look at the experience as a valuable lesson and work for kosen-rufu even harder than before. I would hope that those around them would provide warm support. I also hope that those children who are in single-parent families will not feel lonely but will instead, because of that, open their hearts and expand their circle of friends all the more.\n\nIt is said that most marriages are not 100 percent successful. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that 99 percent of all marriages are unsuccessful!\n\nIn reality, many families who appear to have everything going for them actually have many problems. It was the French essayist Montaigne who said: \u201cThere is hardly less torment in running a family than in running a whole country.\u201d*2\n\nWhen a couple has similar life conditions, it is only natural that they will lock horns from time to time. But if you can take a step back and regard your partner with the compassion you would have for your own child for example, you\u2019ll be able to be more forgiving and empathetic, and avoid unnecessary confrontations. How much better it would be not to take your partner\u2019s nagging so personally, to be bighearted enough to see it as an expression of their natural vitality, a sign that she or he is alive and well. If you can achieve such an expansive life state, then even your partner\u2019s nagging will sound instead like sweet birdsong.\n\nMost important, in any case, is to have love and compassion for one another. Other than that, the key is to chant daimoku together, aspiring for the greatest heights, for true happiness.\n\nAll couples are essentially two separate individuals with different backgrounds and life experiences. That\u2019s why, without patience and a conscious effort to understand each other, they cannot succeed as a couple. It takes patience and perseverance for a couple to make a life together, while striving to create a safe, supportive home environment, to work at their respective jobs, to care for their children and provide them with a proper education, as well as to take action to help others.\n\nHappiness is built on patience and perseverance. There are many who dream about happiness without being willing to invest much effort. But that is merely a dream\u2014a fairy tale, a simplistic and childish view of life. This illusion breaks up many marriages. To seek happiness that way can only end in misery.\n\nMaking steady efforts to build a life together, having the patience and perseverance to move forward together\u2014these are the foundation from which real love develops. Real love means wanting to share your life with the other person forever. Real marriage is when you have been married for 25 years and feel an even deeper love than you did when you first met. True love is something that deepens. Love that does not is on the level of simple attraction or liking.\n\nIt is also important for a couple to thank and praise each other often. It can be for anything\u2014just appreciating and praising each other is what matters. Nothing comes from pointing out the other person\u2019s faults. That\u2019s just foolishness.\n\nCouples should strive to make their home a bright and happy place. You have to decide, \u201cAs long as I\u2019m around, I\u2019ll always make things happy and bright.\u201d If you yourself shine like the sun, there will be no darkness wherever you go in the world. Similarly, if there is one person in the home who shines like the sun, the entire family will be illuminated.\n\nFrom The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra, vol. 6, published in Japanese in August 2000.\nSupplementary Reading\n\nLet us look back to the Headquarters leaders meeting of December 1957\u2014the month that second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda\u2019s lifelong goal of 750,000 member households was achieved. At that historic meeting, Mr. Toda announced three guidelines of faith:\nFaith for a harmonious family\nFaith for each person to achieve happiness*3\nFaith for overcoming obstacles\nSince that time, we have advanced toward kosen-rufu with these points engraved in our hearts as the three eternal guidelines of the Soka Gakkai. Their purpose is to provide a clear direction or focus, so that our members\u2014in their respective lives and circumstances, in their homes, workplaces, and communities\u2014will not be defeated by difficulties nor fall into the trap of negativity and complaint, but will instead live with hope and triumph over all.\n*\nThe first guideline is \u201cFaith for a harmonious family.\u201d Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cThose who now believe in the Lotus Sutra will gather fortune from ten thousand miles away\u201d (WND-1, 1137). He also cites the words of the Great Teacher Dengyo: \u201cWhen in the family honor is paid diligently to the teachings, the seven disasters will most certainly be banished\u201d (WND-2, 1026).\n\nHow wonderful it is to have the sound of the Mystic Law reverberating in the home! Strong faith is like a powerful magnet, attracting good fortune \u201cfrom ten thousand miles away.\u201d It acts as an impenetrable defense that repels all misfortune. With this conviction, please make your homes castles of happiness and peace.\n\nIn many cases, other family members are not practicing the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism. There is no need to worry or grow anxious about this. That is because, if we ourselves stand up earnestly and confidently in faith, we can lead all of our family and relatives in the direction of happiness and hope. We are like a solitary lighthouse on a dark night, enabling numerous ships to safely sail the seas.\n\nThe Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cThe Venerable Maudgalyayana put his faith in the Lotus Sutra, which is the greatest good there is, and thus not only did he himself attain Buddhahood, but his father and mother did so as well. And, amazing as it may seem, all the fathers and mothers of the preceding seven generations and the seven generations that followed, indeed, of countless lifetimes before and after, were able to become Buddhas. In addition, all their sons, their wives or husbands, their retainers, supporters, and countless other persons not only were enabled to escape from the three evil paths, but all attained the first stage of security and then Buddhahood, the stage of perfect enlightenment.\u201d (WND-1, 820)\n\nIn light of this passage, there is absolutely no need for family discord about faith. I hope that you will exhibit a broad-minded wisdom, chanting and working to patiently and steadfastly create happy, harmonious families where good cheer and joyous laughter abound.\n\nThe great French writer Victor Hugo said: \u201cLaughter is like sunshine; it chases winter away from the human face.\u201d*4\n\nSome of you have lost beloved family members. From the Buddhist perspective, however, this has a deep, deep significance, and you mustn\u2019t allow yourselves to be defeated by grief.\n\nMadame Deng Yingchao was preceded in death by her beloved husband, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai. She, more than anyone, was filled with sorrow and grief, but when she saw multitudes of others weeping, she declared: \u201cLet\u2019s be strong. Let\u2019s not cry. Crying won\u2019t bring anyone back to life. I myself wept only on three occasions [after my husband\u2019s passing]. If tears would bring Enlai back, then I would weep with all of my being. What we must do instead is dry our tears and carry on Enlai\u2019s work. . . .\u201d*5\n\nI have observed the lives of innumerable people up to now, and I can say with absolute certainty that all who stood up in faith at a crucial moment have gone on to become happy.\n\nNo prayer to the Gohonzon goes unanswered. The Mystic Law is a great teaching that enables us to change poison into medicine. Through faith, we can transform all sufferings into something positive and beneficial, and develop a higher state of life.\n\nPraising Nanjo Tokimitsu, who inherited the indomitable faith of his father [Nanjo Hyoe Shichiro], the Daishonin writes: \u201cYou and your late father, because you both have faith in the Lotus Sutra, will be reborn . . . together\u201d (WND-2, 500).\n\nFaith is the greatest of all treasures. Passing on correct faith to your children is the surest way for both parent and child, and for the entire family as well, to walk the path of eternal happiness.\n\nIn that respect, too, I hope you will work even harder, both in your homes and in your local areas, to nurture our Future Division members.\n*\nThe second guideline is \u201cFaith for each person to achieve happiness.\u201d [Based on a proposal made by President Ikeda, in the five eternal guidelines this has been simplified to \u201cFaith for achieving happiness.\u201d]\n\nReferring to a Lotus Sutra passage, the Daishonin comments: \u201cIf there are a hundred or a thousand people who uphold this sutra, without a single exception all one hundred or one thousand of them will become Buddhas\u201d (WND-1, 1099). We can definitely become happy. This is the Daishonin\u2019s promise.\n\nFaith equals daily life. While struggling valiantly in the midst of society, we are advancing kosen-rufu for the sake of the Law and for the happiness of our fellow human beings. As a result of these efforts, great benefit wells forth in our lives. We can also lead others with whom we have a connection toward the path of happiness.\n\nIn a famous passage, the Daishonin declares: \u201cWinter always turns to spring. Never, from ancient times on, has anyone heard or seen of winter turning back into autumn. Nor have we ever heard of a believer in the Lotus Sutra who turned into an ordinary [unenlightened] person\u201d (WND-1, 536).\n\nWe are resolved to share this great Buddhist teaching of hope with as many people as possible so that they can form a connection with Buddhism that will lead them to true happiness and fulfillment.\n\nHappiness is not something given to us by others or that comes from somewhere outside. It is something that we ourselves must achieve with our own hearts. As the Daishonin says, \u201cIt is the heart that is important\u201d (WND-1, 1000).\n\nIn another of his writings, we find the statement: \u201cFortune comes from one\u2019s heart and makes one worthy of respect\u201d (WND-1, 1137). Our Buddhist practice enables us to deepen and strengthen our hearts to the ultimate degree.\n\nEach person\u2019s happiness leads to kosen-rufu. President Toda remarked humorously: \u201cWhatever you are doing for yourselves ultimately contributes to kosen-rufu and the world. So I hope that you\u2019ll use most of your efforts in faith for your own happiness, and what\u2019s left over, please send this way for the sake of kosen-rufu.\u201d*6\n\nWhat is important for achieving happiness? The Daishonin repeatedly stresses that it is making sure that we are not deceived or led astray by evil friends, or negative influences, which have the power to \u201cdestroy countless good minds\u201d (cf. WND-2, 135, 258).\n\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, the Daishonin says: \u201cThe element ku in the word kudoku [benefit] means good fortune or happiness. It also refers to the merit achieved by wiping out evil\u201d (OTT, 148). Happiness means defeating the fundamental ignorance inherent in life.*7 There can be no genuine happiness unless we fight against negative influences and devilish functions.\n*\nThe third guideline is \u201cFaith for overcoming obstacles.\u201d The Daishonin writes: \u201cIf you propagate [this teaching], devils will arise without fail. If they did not, there would be no way of knowing that this is the correct teaching\u201d (WND-1, 501).\n\nThe mentors and disciples who practice in accord with the Buddha\u2019s teachings and carry out kosen-rufu are certain to be beset by the three powerful enemies*8 and even greater hatred and jealousy than was experienced during Shakyamuni\u2019s lifetime.\n\nEncountering such obstacles is proof that we are faithfully practicing the correct teaching of Buddhism. Moreover, it is through overcoming obstacles that we can attain the indestructible life state of Buddhahood.\n\nThat is why the Daishonin declares: \u201cAt such a time, the three obstacles and four devils*9 will invariably appear, and the wise will rejoice while the foolish will retreat\u201d (WND-1 637); and \u201cThe greater the hardships befalling him [the votary of the Lotus Sutra], the greater the delight he feels, because of his strong faith\u201d (WND-1, 33). This is the very essence of Nichiren Buddhism and the heart of the Soka Gakkai.\n\nPresident Toda did his utmost to encourage members who were struggling amid various difficulties. He said: \u201cThe Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism is a religion that enables those facing adversity to attain happiness. None is stronger than a person who has faced and triumphed over painful hardships. Such a person can become a real friend and ally to those who are truly suffering.\u201d\n\nAs long as the Soka Gakkai spirit blazes brightly, we will never be deadlocked in our efforts to advance kosen-rufu.\n\n\u201cThose with the heart of a lion king are sure to attain Buddhahood\u201d (WND-1, 302). Stand up and speak out with lionlike courage!\u2014this is the Daishonin\u2019s teaching. Let us continue to overcome all obstacles and win with the invincible heart of a lion king.\n*\nI would now like to offer two new guidelines in addition to the first three. They are:\nFaith for health and long life\nFaith for absolute victory\nTo encourage a sincere follower who was battling illness, the Daishonin wrote:\n\n\u201cLife is the most precious of all treasures. . . . One day of life is more valuable than all the treasures of the major world system. . . . Moreover you have encountered the Lotus Sutra. If you live even one day longer, you can accumulate that much more benefit. How truly precious your life is!\u201d (WND-1, 955)\n\nLife is the most precious treasure of all. May every one of you enjoy good health and longevity, living each irreplaceable day to the fullest and creating infinite and immeasurable value.\n\nThe 21st century is the century of life\u2014which means it is also the century of health and longevity. I hope you will all lead lives of value creation that brilliantly exemplify that ideal.\n\nIn a letter written at the start of a new year, the Daishonin sent these words of encouragement to Nichigen-nyo, the wife of Shijo Kingo: \u201cYou will grow younger, and your good fortune will accumulate\u201d (WND-1, 464). The Mystic Law enables us to grow younger and happier in both body and mind with each passing year.\n\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, the Daishonin states: \u201cWhen, while in these four states of birth, aging, sickness, and death, we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we cause them to waft forth the fragrance of the four virtues [eternity, happiness, true self, and purity]\u201d (OTT, 90). Let\u2019s live vibrantly, filled with confidence and optimism, enjoying this existence fragrant with the four virtues of \u201ceternity, happiness, true self, and purity.\u201d To that end, I hope you will put faith into practice in your daily lives, bringing forth ever greater wisdom.\n\nStrong faith is an important cornerstone of health, because it enables us to draw forth powerful life force, triumph over negative functions, and transform our karma. The Daishonin famously declares: \u201cNam-myoho-renge-kyo is like the roar of a lion. What sickness can therefore be an obstacle?\u201d (WND-1, 412). Through practicing Nichiren Buddhism, we can strengthen our life force, develop our character, and expand our capacity as individuals. It is also important to work for kosen-rufu within the Soka Gakkai, an organization overflowing with incredible energy and vitality.\n\nPresident Toda declared with absolute conviction: \u201cIf you have strong faith, then just as the Lotus Sutra attests, you will obtain fresh, powerful life force, gaining a new lease on life in terms of your business and in terms of your health. . . . [The things you need to sustain your life] will just keep flowing forth, like water bubbling up from the earth.\u201d*10\n\nIt is my sincerest wish that all of my dear fellow members, without exception, will become experts in the art of living long and healthy lives.\n*\nThe fifth guideline is \u201cFaith for absolute victory.\u201d\n\nLet me again cite a passage by the Daishonin that I have referred to many times: \u201cBuddhism primarily concerns itself with victory or defeat, while secular authority is based on the principle of reward and punishment. For this reason, a Buddha is looked up to as the Hero of the World\u201d (WND-1, 835).\n\nBeing victorious is the very heart of Buddhism. In the sutras, the Buddha is given such laudatory titles as \u201cVictor Over All,\u201d \u201cAttainer of the Goal,\u201d \u201cOne Who Has Defeated All Opponents and Is Joyous and Fearless,\u201d \u201cOne Who Shines like the Himalayas Which Surpass All Other Mountains,\u201d and so forth. \u201cBuddha\u201d is another name for an absolute victor.\n\nThe Daishonin writes: \u201cBuddhism is reason. Reason will win over your lord\u201d (WND-1, 839). Hence, there is no way that you will be defeated. The triumph of truth and justice is the ultimate law of the universe itself. Firmly believing that with all of one\u2019s heart is the essence of faith.\n\nWe must win. Only by winning can we achieve justice, secure happiness, and realize kosen-rufu.\n\nFrom a speech at a conference with visiting SGI representatives and leaders of Tokyo No. 2 Area, Tokyo, December 11, 2003.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Translated from Japanese.

When President Ikeda signed the attendance book at the meeting announcing the Soka Gakkai International\u2019s founding in Guam on January 26, 1975, he wrote \u201cWorld\u201d as his nationality. The Soka Gakkai is a proud gathering of global citizens, transcending ethnic and national differences, who work together at the grass roots as fellow human beings for the happiness of all people.\n\nThis chapter presents selections of President Ikeda\u2019s guidance on the importance of good citizenship and global citizenship.\n\nIn this first selection, he emphasizes that Buddhism is a teaching for daily life, and does not exist apart from human life and society.\n\nIn \u201cThe Three Kinds of Treasure,\u201d Nichiren Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cThe heart of the Buddha\u2019s lifetime of teachings is the Lotus Sutra, and the heart of the practice of the Lotus Sutra is found in the \u201c[Bodhisattva] Never Disparaging\u201d chapter. What does Bodhisattva Never Disparaging\u2019s profound respect for people signify? The purpose of the appearance in this world of Shakyamuni Buddha, the lord of teachings, lies in his behavior as a human being.\u201d (WND-1, 851\u201352)\n\nThis is a passage from a letter the Daishonin wrote to his disciple Shijo Kingo in September 1277. At the time, the latter found himself in a dire situation, having angered his feudal lord, Ema, by trying to convert him to the Daishonin\u2019s teachings. Ema fell seriously ill a short time later, and called on Shijo Kingo, who was well-versed in medicine, to treat him. Shijo Kingo was able to regain the favor of his lord as a result, but this provoked the jealousy of his fellow samurai, placing his life in danger.\n\nIn this letter, the Daishonin expresses heartfelt concern for the welfare of his disciple, whom he knew to be hot-tempered, and urges him to exercise all the more self-control and act with caution. This is an example of the Daishonin\u2019s warm and encompassing spirit to embrace everyone and do absolutely everything he could to help them become happy. There is nothing authoritarian in his words. Addressing Shijo Kingo\u2019s weak points, he offers caring and detailed advice to prevent his disciple from making a grave mistake and bringing about his own ruin.\n\nWe can easily imagine how the Daishonin\u2019s deeply compassionate encouragement must have calmed Shijo Kingo down and broadened his perspective.\n\nThe behavior of Bodhisattva Never Disparaging is described in the chapter of the Lotus Sutra bearing his name. No matter how people despised and attacked him, Bodhisattva Never Disparaging was never angered or resentful. Even when he encountered people of overbearing arrogance, he continued to respectfully acknowledge their Buddha nature.\n\nThe Daishonin refers to the behavior of Bodhisattva Never Disparaging in his letter to warn Shijo Kingo not to let his short temper cause him to speak or behave rashly, but instead to be discreet and act wisely. He concludes his advice by stating that the reason for Shakyamuni\u2019s appearance in the world was to teach us how to behave as human beings.\n\nBuddhism is ultimately a teaching about human life and conduct. In that sense, our Buddhist practice is expressed in our words and actions. The important thing is how we lead our lives in society, how we conduct ourselves each day, based on faith in the Mystic Law. Each of those actions helps pave the way for our attainment of Buddhahood.\n\nThere is a famous passage in the Daishonin\u2019s treatise \u201cOn Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land\u201d: \u201cYou have associated with a friend in the orchid room and have become as straight as mugwort growing among hemp\u201d (WND-1, 23).\n\nAn \u201corchid room\u201d is a room filled with sweet-smelling orchids. Just as one who dwells in such a room will gradually be imbued with the fragrance of the orchids, those who associate with people of outstanding character who believe in the correct teaching of Buddhism will eventually be awakened to the validity of that teaching themselves. \u201cAssociate\u201d here means to actually come into contact with their words and behavior.\n\nIn this treatise the host (Nichiren Daishonin) presents the correct teaching to a visiting guest. When the guest reacts emotionally, becoming enraged, the host remains unperturbed. When the guest is about to storm away angrily, the host smiles soothingly, urges him to stay, and continues patiently to explain the correct teaching.\n\nInfluenced by the host\u2019s actions, which embody compassion and reason, as well as the \u201cfragrance\u201d of his noble character, the guest gradually begins to open his heart. In the end, he discards his attachment to erroneous views and seeks the correct teaching. Reading this treatise is like watching a drama of dialogue unfold before our eyes.\n\nBuddhism doesn\u2019t exist apart from the reality of society, or from people and their lives. No matter how valid the teachings of Buddhism may be, just loudly proclaiming that fact will not persuade people. If anything, that approach is quite likely to drive them away from the path of Buddhism, and that would be going against the intent of the Daishonin, who entrusted us with the mission of realizing kosen-rufu.\n\nWhen we try to help people gain an understanding of the greatness of Nichiren Buddhism, the first thing they look at is our daily behavior. How do we live our lives? Are we people of character and integrity? People observe us very closely. If we are careless about money matters or lack good judgment, if we behave in an arrogant, conceited manner, then, irrespective of how wonderful this Buddhism is, people will not believe us.\n\nWinning people\u2019s trust and understanding is very important. Buddhism teaches that when we uphold the supreme Law, we can come to shine as people of unsurpassed character.\n\nWe of the Soka Gakkai have widely spread understanding of Nichiren Buddhism while polishing our own humanity so that it shines brightly. We have made efforts to be the \u201cfriends in the orchid room\u201d to people in society.\n\nIt is by developing our humanity through our Buddhist practice\u2014cultivating unshakable conviction, hope for the future, warm concern for others, rich wisdom, passion for our mission, and an expansive, all-embracing state of life\u2014that we will inspire others and open their hearts to our message.\n\nFrom a speech at an Okinawa Prefecture executive conference, Okinawa, February 8, 1991.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 13: \u201cFaith for a Harmonious Family\u201d [13.6]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 14: \u201cBe Good Citizens!\u201d [14.2]"}, {"title": "chapter-14-2.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 14: \u201cBe Good Citizens!\u201d [14.2]\n14.2 Be People Who Shine through Their Behavior\nPresident Ikeda explains that by winning the trust of others through our behavior as human beings, we can show wonderful actual proof of the greatness of Buddhism.\n\nPresident Makiguchi often used to say: \u201cThere are three kinds of people in the world\u2014those everyone wants to have around, those whose presence or absence doesn\u2019t make a difference, and those whose presence causes problems. Always try to be the kind of person that others want to have around, both in your home and your workplace.\u201d\n\nBecoming people who are trusted, respected, and liked by all\u2014indispensable people who are needed at home, at work, and in our community\u2014is the way to show the validity of our Buddhist practice and advance our movement for kosen-rufu.\n\nIn a letter to his disciple Shijo Kingo, Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cLive so that all the people of Kamakura will say in your praise that Nakatsukasa Saburo Saemon-no-jo [Shijo Kingo] is diligent in the service of his lord, in the service of Buddhism, and in his concern for other people\u201d (WND-1, 851).\n\nAt the time, Shijo Kingo was facing considerable hardship. Envious colleagues had made false accusations about him to his lord, who responded by confiscating some of his estates. The Daishonin advised Shijo Kingo that instead of bemoaning his situation, he should work on developing himself and strive to grow as a human being. This, he explained, was the most genuine and noble way for a person to live and the path that a Buddhist practitioner should take.\n\nEven if we are subjected to unfounded criticism or attack, we should remain undisturbed and keep living our lives in the right way. By doing so, we will win the praise and respect of others in the end.\n\nIt is in our behavior as human beings that the teachings of Buddhism come alive and actual proof of our Buddhist practice is revealed. Our courteous, humane conduct can be said to be an expression of correct faith.\n\nIn addition to being good practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism, I hope you will also be good neighbors, good citizens, and good members of your local community and society. May you win the praise, respect, and trust of others through such behavior. Spreading circles of bright, deep, ever-widening trust and understanding is the key to expanding our movement for kosen-rufu.\n\nFrom a speech at a Rio de Janeiro representatives conference, Brazil, February 10, 1993.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 14: \u201cBe Good Citizens!\u201d [14.1]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 14: \u201cBe Good Citizens!\u201d [14.3]"}, {"title": "chapter-14-3.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 14: \u201cBe Good Citizens!\u201d [14.3]\n14.3 Being Responsible, Good Citizens\nSpeaking to members in Sweden, President Ikeda outlines the fundamental spirit for practicing Nichiren Buddhism\u2014being considerate of one\u2019s neighbors, respecting the culture and customs of the land in which one lives, and spreading Buddhism at a steady, unhurried pace.\n\nAs this is my first visit to Sweden, I would like to offer my thoughts on some basic points.\n\nFirst, I hope you will show care for your neighbors. We do not live in isolation; we exist as members of a community. We need to be considerate of one another. That is just common sense. If we simply assert our own rights or what suits our convenience, we are not responsible members of society.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cBuddhism is reason\u201d (WND-1, 839). As Soka Gakkai members, who uphold the Daishonin\u2019s teachings, it\u2019s important that we be reasonable and show sound judgment.\n\nI hope you will not only be considerate of and courteous to your own neighbors, but also those of this community center where many members gather. When you see the local residents, please offer them a bright and pleasant greeting. I hope you will take utmost care not to bother or inconvenience anyone or make them feel uneasy. Through continuing such sincere efforts, you are sure to eventually spread understanding of Nichiren Buddhism and make this center a true citadel of happiness in the community.\n\nFostering mutual trust as fellow human beings is important. Never be self-righteous. Remember that the flow of kosen-rufu in the community is secured by reassuring people and winning their praise and admiration through your exemplary behavior as practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you never greet the residents living near the center and then disturb them by making lots of noise late at night or early in the morning\u2014noise from ringing phones, people entering and leaving the center, or cars and motorcycles arriving and departing\u2014you are breaking the rules of good-neighborliness. I hope you will also take care not to talk loudly on the streets outside or near the center, or thoughtlessly litter the area with cigarette butts and other trash.\n\nNo matter how fine your words or meaningful your activities, it is by such very ordinary behavior that people judge you. This is true everywhere. Such failings in the past have seriously hampered the progress of kosen-rufu.\n\nIn Buddhism, the term \u201csutra\u201d [Jpn. kyo] means scripture or teaching. In a broader sense, it means that which expresses the lives of all living beings\u2014that is, all our words and actions. We are each \u201creciting\u201d our own sutra through our own words and actions.\n\nNam-myoho-renge-kyo, in this sense, is the supreme sutra. As those who embrace this highest sutra, we must strive as much as we can to improve and refine our words and actions.\n\nAs for the second point, I hope you will respect the culture and customs of the land in which you live.\n\nThe Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin encompasses the entire universe and equally illuminates the lives of all people. It is not a Japanese religion, but a religion for all humankind. There\u2019s no need for us, therefore, as practitioners of the Mystic Law, to cling to Japanese culture, ways of thinking, or language.\n\nOf course, we must remain strict about the basics of faith and practice, but Sweden has its own culture and traditions, its own customs and practices that have evolved over the course of its history. As long as such traditions and customs do not contradict the essential teachings of Buddhism, it is only natural for you as Swedish members to value that heritage. To quarrel or give the impression of being rigid or narrow-minded about such matters in fact runs counter to the tolerant, broad-minded spirit of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nI hope that while basing yourselves on the Daishonin\u2019s teachings, you will all be good citizens who abide by the laws and customs of the land in which you live and win the trust and acceptance of everyone around you.\n\nThe third point I wish to share is not to be impatient in spreading Buddhism.\n\nThe Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin is the Buddhism of sowing*1 implicit in the Lotus Sutra. The foundation of our practice is chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo ourselves and reaching out to interact with others to bring them into contact with the Mystic Law. Whether they start practicing or not is a separate issue. There are two ways the seeds of the Law can be planted: \u201csowing the seeds by letting people hear the teaching,\u201d which means to enable others to hear about Buddhism, and \u201csowing the seeds by leading people to arouse faith in the teaching,\u201d*2 which means enabling them to accept and have faith in the Gohonzon. Both are equally excellent forms of propagation. They both produce the same benefits.\n\nThe majority of the world\u2019s people as yet know nothing of the teachings, or even the name, of Nichiren Buddhism. Our mission is to sow the seeds of the Mystic Law\u2014in other words, the seeds for peace and happiness\u2014in their lives. In most cases, by simply interacting with others as true friends and communicating sincerely and openly, we will help them form a connection with Buddhism. It is also important that we continue to pray for the happiness of those individuals. Later, we may have an opportunity to talk to them in a very natural way about our Buddhism of sowing.\n\nBut never get into arguments over faith or be persistent to the point where you both end up getting angry and upset. Just continue to cherish your sincere wish that the other person will accept this Buddhism. There is no need to be impatient or feel pressured to get someone to start practicing. Once you have helped someone form a connection with Buddhism, the time will surely come when the seed you have planted will sprout and blossom.\n\nFrom a speech at the opening of the Swedish Culture Center, Sweden, June 3, 1989.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Buddhism of sowing: Buddhism that plants the seeds of Buddhahood, or the cause for attaining Buddhahood, in people\u2019s lives. In Nichiren\u2019s teachings, the Buddhism of sowing indicates the Buddhism of Nichiren, in contrast with that of Shakyamuni, which is called the Buddhism of the harvest. The Buddhism of the harvest is that which can lead to enlightenment only those who received the seeds of Buddhahood by practicing the Buddha\u2019s teaching in previous lifetimes. In contrast, the Buddhism of sowing implants the seeds of Buddhahood, or Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, in the lives of those who had no connection with the Buddha\u2019s teaching in their past existences, i.e., the people of the Latter Day of the Law.\n*2There are two ways of sowing the seeds of Buddhahood: \u201csowing the seeds by letting one hear the teaching\u201d and \u201csowing the seeds by leading one to arouse faith in the teaching.\u201d In The Annotations on \u201cThe Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra,\u201d the Great Teacher Miao-lo of China states: \u201cWhether one accepts or rejects the teaching, it enters one\u2019s ears and one thus establishes a bond with it. And then, though one may comply with or go against it, in the end one will be able to achieve liberation because of this bond.\u201d \u201cSowing the seeds by letting one hear the teaching\u201d thus means that simply by hearing the Law one forms the cause, or seed, for attaining Buddhahood eventually, even if one should reject it initially.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 14: \u201cBe Good Citizens!\u201d [14.2]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 14: \u201cBe Good Citizens!\u201d [14.4]"}, {"title": "chapter-14-4.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 14: \u201cBe Good Citizens!\u201d [14.4]\n14.4 Kosen-rufu Starts from Actions in Daily Life\nPresident Ikeda stresses that our human revolution takes place not on some distant stage, but is based on our everyday actions and behavior, and in our compassionate, caring interactions with those in our lives.\n\nThe French philosopher Voltaire wrote of happiness: \u201cBe wise for your own sake. Be compassionate toward your fellow men. Build your happiness through the happiness of others.\u201d*1\n\n\u201cBuild your happiness through the happiness of others\u201d\u2014these are profound words, words that resonate with our Buddhist practice of striving for the happiness of both ourselves and others. True happiness cannot be found in the egoism of pursuing one\u2019s own happiness alone. Only in sincere practice motivated by a wish for the happiness of others can we attain our own happiness, which is why such action is the wisest course for ourselves as well.\n\nNothing is more important than our everyday efforts and conduct. This is where our true humanity shines.\n\nAnd Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire\u2019s contemporary, said: \u201cDistrust those cosmopolitans who search out remote duties in their books and neglect those that lie nearest.\u201d*2\n\nDeep philosophical discussions are fine, and high ideals are important. Inspiring lectures on the Daishonin\u2019s writings certainly have their role. But we must never become hollow ideologues who make fine speeches about love for humanity while failing to cherish those around us. People who shirk hard work and are intoxicated by their own lofty rhetoric may have a high opinion of themselves, but they are, in fact, far from admirable.\n\nIt is easy to be attracted to abstract ideals, but difficult to challenge the realities of daily life. I hope that while upholding the magnificent ideal of kosen-rufu, you will spend your days in the actual practice of encouraging and motivating one person and then another and another to contribute to kosen-rufu. This is the practice, the hard work, of propagating the Mystic Law in the real world.\n\nFrom a speech at a student division summer training course, Shizuoka, July 21, 1987.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Translated from Japanese.

As an individual and a member of society, your most precious possession is your life. That\u2019s why I urge you to please take good care of your health. Looking after our health and taking steps to prevent illness reflect the wisdom of our Buddhist practice.\u201d\n\nMaintaining good health is an important requirement for being victorious in society. When we\u2019re filled with vitality and high spirits, we can strive our hardest and play a truly positive and productive role in our workplace.\n\nBuddhism is based on reason. If we overeat, drink too much, don\u2019t get enough sleep, and work too hard, we\u2019ll eventually feel the ill effects of that behavior, become sick, or cause an accident. To prevent that from happening, we need to act wisely and lead a sound, value-creating life. That is the way of genuine practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nIt\u2019s vital to lead healthy, well-balanced lives, carry out a refreshing and invigorating daily practice of gongyo, and do our best at work and in our communities, brimming with energy and vitality.\n\nShin\u2019ichi then spoke about the importance of family. When our family life is stable, we can bring forth our fullest potential in the workplace. Happiness is ultimately found close to home, in our relationships with our family and loved ones. What we teach our children at home also plays a very important role in fostering successors in faith. To create strong and happy families is to build bright beacons that light the way for kosen-rufu in the community.\n\nNext, Shin\u2019ichi turned to the correct Buddhist attitude in striving for success at work: \u201cTo excel at our jobs, we need to completely discard the idea that everything will just fall into place because we are practicing Nichiren Buddhism. That\u2019s a misguided way of thinking, a form of arrogance that goes against the Daishonin\u2019s teaching that we should regard our work as our Buddhist practice. Always remember that correct faith means having utmost wisdom and common sense.\u201d\n\nBuddhism is a way of life. Winning the trust of those around us and demonstrating proof of victory in our workplaces leads directly to victory in our lives and in Buddhism. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to play a vibrant and active role in our workplaces and communities.\n\nWarmly encouraging the members present, Shin\u2019ichi continued: \u201cIn society, we have to interact with all kinds of people, and sometimes even attend the observances of other religions. We mustn\u2019t be narrow-minded or close ourselves off. Instead, we should be wise and broad-minded, reaching out to form friendly ties with others. Nichiren Buddhism is a religion that exists for people\u2019s happiness.\n\n\u201cWe mustn\u2019t wall ourselves off from society or become insular and intolerant because of our faith. Nor is there ever any need to get into arguments at home or at work about our Buddhist faith. That\u2019s completely counterproductive. As practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism, it\u2019s more valuable to take a long-term perspective, being warmly supportive of our family members and coworkers and doing what we can to help them become happy.\u201d\n\nOver the centuries, there have been a number of Nichiren Buddhist groups that have been seen as extremist and prone to exclusionary and self-righteous behavior. In fact, before World War II, groups claiming to champion the ideals of Nichiren Buddhism committed acts of violence. This is an intolerable affront to the lofty spirit of Nichiren Daishonin, who regarded all individuals as possessing the Buddha nature and sought happiness for all. It represents a failure to understand that Buddhists should behave as responsible members of their society, as indicated by the principle that \u201cBuddhism manifests itself in society.\u201d\n\nIn closing, Shin\u2019ichi emphasized the importance of common sense: \u201cMembers who incur the disdain of those around them through their extreme words and actions have one thing in common. They tend to be people who have \u2018faith like fire\u2019\u2014exerting themselves in their practice with passion and a great show of enthusiasm for a brief moment, but soon discarding it. The key to faith lies in continuing\u2014as the Daishonin affirms when he says: \u2018To accept is easy; to continue is difficult. But Buddhahood lies in continuing faith\u2019 (WND-1, 471).\n\n\u201cKosen-rufu is realized gradually through our steady, persistent efforts to spread our network of trust in our workplaces and communities.

Brilliant educator that he was, he strove to foster \u201cindividuals with the intelligence to recognize their own shortcomings and find the strong points of others.\u201d*1 He also strove to produce \u201cgenerous individuals who supplement their shortcomings with the strengths of others, while also unstintingly supplementing the shortcomings of others with their own strengths.\u201d*2\n\nThis is the essential spirit of Soka education and the key to creating a harmonious Soka family.\n\nI hope that our members, in their respective countries and communities, will advance in just this sort of beautiful unity of \u201cmany in body, one in mind.\u201d\n\nMr. Makiguchi also argued that there were three distinct levels of life: (1) a dependent life, (2) an independent life, and (3) a contributive life. *3\n\nIn a broad sense, a dependent life is one lacking any clear sense of self or purpose, allowing oneself to be controlled by circumstances.\n\nMany religions throughout history have demanded blind faith and robbed people of their autonomy. Mr. Makiguchi utterly opposed such unthinking obedience. He believed that people should have an independent sense of self, or self-identity, and follow their chosen path\u2014a fair description of the second level, an independent life.\n\nHe further urged that we rise to the next level, in which we have respect for others and work for their happiness and well-being instead of caring only about ourselves and growing smug and self-complacent. This is the level of a contributive life, where we make the attainment of happiness for both ourselves and others our life\u2019s goal.\n\nMr. Makiguchi called on us to build a network of awakened individuals, of people who had elevated themselves from dependence to independence and, finally, contribution to others\u2014a level where they could take action to their hearts\u2019 content and shine their brightest.\n\nThe Soka Gakkai is a noble, humanistic organization whose members are leading just such contributive lives. Upholding the great Law of life, they are tirelessly contributing to people\u2019s happiness, the flourishing of culture and society, and the realization of world peace.\n\nFrom a speech at an SGI Pan-Pacific peace and culture conference, U.S.A., January 29, 1995.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Translated from Japanese.

In this excerpt from one of his peace proposals, he elaborates on this point, referring to the speech he made on the occasion of the SGI\u2019s establishment.\n\nMy point in introducing the concept of the bodhisattva is this: Human rights will only become truly universal and indivisible when they span the most basic, existential division\u2014that of self and other. And this can only occur when both the right to, and duty of humane treatment are observed, not in response to externally imposed norms, but through spontaneous action stemming from the naturally powerful desire to assist our fellows whose ability to live in a humane manner is under threat.\n\nTwenty-three years ago (on January 26, 1975), I appealed to members of the newly formed SGI, saying: \u201cRather than seeking after your own praise or glory, I hope that you will dedicate your noble lives to sowing the seeds of peace of the Mystic Law throughout the entire world.\u201d Just as unhappiness is not something only others suffer, neither can happiness be for ourselves only. In this sense, my appeal was a cry from the depths of my heart that we should live the bodhisattva way of life: overcoming the small self of the ego, developing an extended, more inclusive, \u201cgreater self\u201d\u2014seeing ourselves in others and feeling others to be part of ourselves.\n\nAs good citizens of their respective societies, the members of the SGI are working to advance a movement for peace, culture, and education. In the immediate context of their daily lives, they act with the bodhisattva spirit, refusing to ignore or abandon those who are suffering. They initiate and carry out countless acts for the benefit of others, striving to encourage this person, to relieve the anguish of that person, and to help those around them. I am proud of them and believe theirs are the kind of quiet, grassroots endeavors that will certainly help create the human rights culture that our times demand. It is my belief that if we can foster, in the depths of each individual human life, the kind of active, independent basis for altruistic behavior exemplified in the bodhisattva\u2019s vow, we can establish the fundamental foundation for an ethic of responsibility and commitment upon which a genuine culture of human rights can flourish.\n\nFrom a peace proposal commemorating the 23rd SGI Day, January 26, 1998.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 14: \u201cBe Good Citizens!\u201d [14.6]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 14: \u201cBe Good Citizens!\u201d [14.8]"}, {"title": "chapter-14-8.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 14: \u201cBe Good Citizens!\u201d [14.8]\n14.8 The Qualities of Global Citizens\nTo be a good citizen of our country is to be a global citizen. Here, President Ikeda discusses three essential elements of global citizenship\u2014wisdom, courage, and compassion\u2014and shines a light on the bodhisattva way of life that opposes divisiveness and aims for harmonious coexistence and unity.\n\nWhat are the conditions for global citizenship?\n\nOver the past several decades, I have been privileged to meet and converse with many people from all walks of life, and I have given the matter some thought. Certainly, global citizenship is not determined merely by the number of languages one speaks, or the number of countries to which one has traveled. I have many friends who could be considered quite ordinary citizens, but who possess an inner nobility; who have never traveled beyond their native place, yet who are genuinely concerned for the peace and prosperity of the world.\n\nI think I can state with confidence that the following are essential elements of global citizenship:\nThe wisdom to perceive the interconnectedness of all life.\nThe courage not to fear or deny difference, but to respect and strive to understand people of different cultures, and to grow from encounters with them.\nThe compassion to maintain an imaginative empathy that reaches beyond one\u2019s immediate surroundings and extends to those suffering in distant places.\nThe all-encompassing interrelatedness that forms the core of the Buddhist worldview can provide a basis, I feel, for the concrete realization of these qualities of wisdom, courage, and compassion. The following parable from the Buddhist canon provides a beautiful visual metaphor for the interdependence and interpenetration of all phenomena.\n\nSuspended above the palace of Indra, the Buddhist god who symbolizes the natural forces that protect and nurture life, is an enormous net. A brilliant jewel is attached to each of the knots of the net. Each jewel contains and reflects the image of all the other jewels in the net, which sparkles in the magnificence of its totality.\n\nWhen we learn to recognize what Henry David Thoreau referred to as \u201cthe infinite extent of our relations,\u201d*1 we can trace the strands of mutually supportive life, and discover there the glittering jewels of our global neighbors. Buddhism seeks to cultivate wisdom grounded in this kind of empathetic resonance with all forms of life. In the Buddhist view, wisdom and compassion are intimately linked and mutually reinforcing. Compassion in Buddhism does not involve the forcible suppression of our natural emotions, our likes and dislikes. Rather, it is the realization that even those we dislike have qualities that can contribute to our lives, and can afford us the opportunity to grow in our own humanity. Further, it is the compassionate desire to find ways of contributing to the well-being of others that gives rise to limitless wisdom.\n\nBuddhism teaches that both good and evil are potentialities that exist in all people. Compassion consists in the sustained and courageous effort to seek out the good in any person, whoever they may be, however they may behave. It means striving, through sustained engagement, to cultivate the positive qualities in oneself and in others. Engagement, however, requires courage. There are all too many cases in which compassion, owing to a lack of courage, remains mere sentiment. Buddhism calls a person who embodies these qualities of wisdom, courage, and compassion, who strives without cease for the happiness of others, a bodhisattva. In this sense, it could be said that the bodhisattva provides an ancient precedent and modern exemplar of the global citizen.\n\nThe Buddhist canon also includes the story of a contemporary of Shakyamuni, a woman by the name of Shrimala, who dedicated herself to education, teaching others that the practice of the bodhisattva consists in encouraging, with maternal care, the ultimate potential for good within all people. Her vow is recorded thus: If I see lonely people, people who have been jailed unjustly and have lost their freedom, people who are suffering from illness, disaster or poverty, I will not abandon them. I will bring them spiritual and material comfort.*2\n\nIn concrete terms, her practice consisted of the following:\nEncouraging others by addressing them with kindness and concern, through dialogue (Skt. priyavacana).\nGiving alms, or providing people with the things they require (Skt. dana).\nTaking action on behalf of others (Skt. artha-carya).\nJoining with others, and working together with them (Skt. samanartha).\nThrough these efforts, Shrimala sought to realize her goal of bringing forth the positive aspects of those she encountered.\n\nThe practice of the bodhisattva is supported by a profound faith in the inherent goodness of people. Knowledge must be directed to the task of unleashing this creative, positive potential. This purposefulness can be likened to the skill that enables one to make use of the precision instruments of an airplane to reach a destination safely and without incident. For this reason, the insight to perceive the evil that causes destruction and divisiveness, and that is equally part of human nature, is also necessary. The bodhisattva\u2019s practice is an unshrinking confrontation with what Buddhism calls the fundamental ignorance.*3\n\n\u201cGoodness\u201d can be defined as that which moves us in the direction of harmonious coexistence, empathy, and solidarity with others. The nature of evil, on the other hand, is to divide: people from people, humanity from the rest of nature. The pathology of divisiveness drives people to an unreasoning attachment to difference and blinds them to human commonalities. This is not limited to individuals, but constitutes the deep psychology of collective egoism, which takes its most destructive form in virulent strains of ethnocentrism and nationalism. The struggle to rise above such egoism and live in larger and more contributive realms of selfhood constitutes the core of the bodhisattva\u2019s practice.\n\nFrom a lecture at Columbia University Teachers College, \u201cThoughts on Education for Global Citizenship,\u201d U.S.A., June 13, 1996.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Henry David Thoreau, \u201cThe Village,\u201d in Walden, The Selected Works of Thoreau, edited by Walter Harding (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1975), p. 359.\n*2See The Lion\u2019s Roar of Queen Srimala: A Buddhist Scripture on the Tathagata-garbha Theory, translated by Alex Wayman and Hideko Wayman (New York: Columbia University Press, 1974), p. 65.\n*3Fundamental ignorance: The most deeply rooted illusion inherent in life, said to give rise to all other illusions.

He once remarked: \u201cA good world citizen must start by being a good family member, a good fellow worker or professional, and a good member of the local community. Starting with fundamentals of this kind has a great impact on deep reform; this relates to your idea that a single individual can change the environment, region, nation and even the whole world.\u201d*1 This is an important observation.\n\nOur organization has advanced under the motto \u201cBe good citizens.\u201d Furthermore, it upholds \u201cfaith for a harmonious family\u201d among its eternal guidelines.\n\nBecoming a global citizen begins nowhere else but within one\u2019s family, workplace, and community. Let us confirm once again that it is our sure and steady efforts in these areas that form the first steps toward any lasting reform. Wherever we find ourselves at the present moment, that is the place to rise into action, burning with commitment, passion, and hope. When we ourselves move forward with new vitality as if totally rejuvenated, our local organizations and communities will likewise begin to achieve fresh and dynamic growth.\n\nWe can create a proud record of accomplishment in life by positively advancing kosen-rufu through sharing Buddhism with those around us, and by striving to help others as we make our way together along the path of happiness.\n\nFrom a speech at a Tokyo No. 2 Area executive conference, Tokyo, November 18, 2005.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Ricardo D\u00edez-Hochleitner and Daisaku Ikeda, A Dialogue Between East and West: Looking to a Human Revolution (London: I.

A life without problems is empty and uneventful. It offers no opportunity for achieving human revolution or changing one\u2019s karma. Inner joy and true happiness are found in enduring and overcoming adversity. This is the foundation of Nichiren Buddhism. Those who surmount hardships and adversity become Buddhas.\u201d\n\nEncountering adversity in the course of our Buddhist practice\u2014whether a problem in daily life or a challenge in the realm of faith\u2014is proof that we are making significant progress in our human revolution and efforts to transform our karma. As such, hardships are badges of honor for practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nThis chapter features President Ikeda\u2019s guidance relating to \u201cfaith for overcoming obstacles,\u201d one of the five eternal guidelines of the Soka Gakkai.*1\n\nIn this first selection, he explains the significance of hardships we encounter in faith, especially in our youth.\n\nMy mentor, second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda, always encouraged young people to read books, especially famous works of literature. He sternly reprimanded those who didn\u2019t. If he discovered us reading magazines of no positive value, he would erupt in anger.\n\nI remember eagerly reading in my youth the writings of Eiji Yoshikawa, author of such historical novels as The Three Kingdoms and Miyamoto Musashi.\n\nYoshikawa once said to a young man of privilege: \u201cYou are an unfortunate youth. For there is no greater misfortune than seeing too much beauty and partaking of too much fine cuisine from an early age. It is sad to see a young person\u2019s sensitivity\u2013\u2013his ability to perceive joy as joy\u2013\u2013become dulled.\u201d*2 These words have remained with me all my life.\n\nThose who, in the all-important years for laying the foundation of their lives, are blessed with every possible comfort, are coddled and pampered, lack nothing, or never experience any hardships, are not by any means happy or fortunate. They are in fact the most unfortunate. There is no way they will grow into great individuals.\n\nThe absence of hardship is not happiness. True happiness and joy in life are found in not being defeated by hardship, by picking ourselves up again when we fall down, by weathering and triumphing over adversity.\n\nLife is a battle.\n\nLife is a challenge.\n\nLife is training.\n\nDifficulties are an inescapable part of life. Our practice of Nichiren Buddhism empowers us to build a strong self that can bravely face every trial we encounter, enabling us to challenge the situation with a positive spirit and see it as a chance for growth. Those who have this fighting spirit win in the end.\n\nFrom a speech at a joint training session for SGI-Brazil women\u2019s division leaders and Tohoku, Hokuriku, and Shin\u2019etsu representatives, Nagano, August 21, 2004.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Five eternal guidelines for the Soka Gakkai: President Ikeda has set forth five eternal guidelines for the Soka Gakkai: (1) Faith for a harmonious family, (2) Faith for achieving happiness, (3) Faith for overcoming obstacles, (4) Faith for health and long life, and (5) Faith for absolute victory.

This accords with reason, and Buddhism is based on reason.\n\nThat\u2019s why Nichiren Daishonin repeatedly instructs us to persevere in our Buddhist practice throughout our lives, never quitting along the way or straying from the path of faith, no matter what happens.\n\nA life without struggle and challenge, a life free from hardship and difficulty, might seem pleasant and easy; but just as a child who is never exposed to the outside air grows up to be weak and frail, a life, a spirit, that is never tested or tempered cannot attain true happiness. Happiness can only exist in the heart of a person with a strong, solid self that is able to confidently overcome anything.\n\nIn that sense, being able to train and forge ourselves through facing repeated difficulties is in itself a source of happiness. And more than anything, our Buddhist practice dedicated to the realization of kosen-rufu hones us into people of \u201cdiamond-like\u201d happiness.\n\nThe more we train and exercise our body, brain, and spirit, the stronger we become, the more we improve, and the more potential we can draw forth. Without exercise, we soon deteriorate and can easily fall ill. This is only natural from a medical perspective.\n\nIn the realm of faith, too, it is only by continually challenging ourselves amid hardships and difficulties that we can attain a state of absolutely indestructible happiness.\n\nThe Daishonin states: \u201cDifficulties will arise, and these are to be looked on as [peace and comfort]\u201d (cf. OTT, 115).\n\nThe realm of kosen-rufu\u2014in which we see difficulties as peace and comfort, as a badge of honor, and advance while surmounting every obstacle\u2014is the \u201csoil\u201d in which people of truly great character are nurtured. This is the great path for building lasting happiness, and, just as the Daishonin instructs, it is the royal road by which the correct teaching is being spread widely.\n\nFrom a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Osaka, March 4, 1991.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.1]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.3]"}, {"title": "chapter-15-3.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.3]\n15.3 Do Not Succumb to the \u201cEight Winds\u201d\nBuddhism teaches of the \u201ceight winds,\u201d or eight influences, that can obstruct our Buddhist practice. A bodhisattva is able to view these phenomena as obstacles and, undisturbed by them, persevere with steadfast faith.\n\nThe higher a mountain, the stronger the winds that buffet it. The peaks of the Himalayas, the king of all mountain ranges, are constantly pounded by violent winds. According to weather data, winter temperatures in the Himalayas may drop to as low as minus 40 degrees Celsius [minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit] and relentless icy gales sometimes reach speeds of more than 100 meters per second [224 miles per hour]. But in even the strongest wind, the \u201cking of mountain ranges\u201d towers with majestic dignity and imperturbable calm.\n\nBuddhism teaches that we should live our lives with the perfect serenity and composure of the Himalayas, not bending in the least before the eight winds, which might otherwise extinguish the flame of our Buddhist practice. In his writing \u201cThe Eight Winds,\u201d Nichiren Daishonin states:\n\n\u201cWorthy [wise] persons deserve to be called so because they are not carried away by the eight winds: prosperity, decline, disgrace, honor, praise, censure, suffering, and pleasure. They are neither elated by prosperity nor grieved by decline. The heavenly gods will surely protect one who is unbending before the eight winds.\u201d (WND-1, 796)\n\nThe eight winds consist of four favorable winds and four unfavorable winds. The first four, which people generally favor and tend to seek, are (1) prosperity (profit of various kinds), (2) honor (accolades from society), (3) praise (admiration from people), and (4) pleasure (physical and spiritual gratification). The remaining four, which people on the whole find disagreeable and tend to shun, are (5) decline (loss of various kinds), (6) disgrace (being dishonored and humiliated by others), (7) censure (being criticized or disparaged), and (8) suffering. Buddhism teaches that we must not allow ourselves to be swayed by the eight winds and let them cause us to abandon our Buddhist practice.\n\nOne Buddhist scripture*1 states that the mind of a bodhisattva who does not succumb to the eight winds is \u201cas firm and unmoving as Mount Sumeru.\u201d*2\n\nBodhisattvas are courageous individuals who plunge headlong into the very thick of society to lead others to happiness. What kind of character should bodhisattvas possess? Shakyamuni asserts that they should have hearts that are invulnerable to assaults from the eight winds.\n\nThis perfectly describes the members of the Soka Gakkai. We do not hold discussion meetings or carry out Soka Gakkai activities for the sake of self-interest or material gain, nor is there someone constantly at our side praising our efforts. On the contrary, we are often subjected to unjust criticism and abuse from people in society and have a hard time because of it. Despite this, all of you continue to take action for the happiness of others, for Buddhism, and for society. Your conduct is truly that of noble bodhisattvas of the present age.\n\nThe Daishonin warns against succumbing to the eight winds, stating that those who can remain unaffected by them are not only wise, but will receive the protection of the heavenly deities, the positive forces of the universe.\n\nWhy is it that, in the face of an endless onslaught of attacks, the Soka Gakkai has managed to achieve such remarkable development in Japan and around the globe? It is because all of you have persevered with sincere, steadfast faith, unswayed by the eight winds, just as the Daishonin teaches. That is why we have been thoroughly protected by the heavenly deities.\n\nPresident Toda said: \u201cWe should be neither elated by praise nor alarmed by insults. It is important that our faith be unwavering.\u201d*3\n\nRefusing to be swayed by any of the eight winds, let us continue to build an even more majestic and dignified mountain of the Soka Gakkai that will last for all eternity. Let us make it as lofty and grand as that king of mountain ranges, the peerless Himalayas!\n\nFrom a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Tokyo, January 27, 1996.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Brahma Excellent Thought Sutra.\n*2Mount Sumeru: In ancient Indian cosmology, the mountain that stands at the center of the world.\n*3Translated from Japanese.

I know your faith has always been admirable, but now you must strengthen it more than ever. Only then will the ten demon daughters*1 [protective deities in Buddhism] lend you even greater protection.\u201d (WND-1, 614)\n\nHowever hard we may have exerted ourselves in the past, the important thing is how we challenge ourselves from now on. We need to rouse even stronger faith than we have before. The heavenly deities, or benevolent functions of the universe, will protect us if we do. The appearance of the \u201cthree powerful enemies\u201d*2 and the \u201cthree obstacles and four devils\u201d*3\u2014of any kind of hardship\u2014is simply a test of our faith, all necessary for us to bring forth the life state of Buddhahood.\n\nThat\u2019s why strengthening our faith even further is the way to overcome hardships and to triumph. As long as we have strong faith, there is no hardship we cannot overcome. As the Daishonin states: \u201cSince [we] believe solely in the Lotus Sutra . . . [we] can enter the treasure tower of the Gohonzon\u201d (cf. WND-1, 832). Embracing the Gohonzon of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and striving to realize kosen-rufu enables us to enter the realm of Buddhahood that is the palace of happiness within our lives, wherever we are and whatever our circumstances.

When we dauntlessly tackle those obstacles, we can attain a vast life state of genuine peace and ease.\n\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, the Daishonin comments on the \u201cPeaceful Practices\u201d (14th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra: \u201cConcerning the \u2018peaceful\u2019 practices of the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Law and the practices carried out by Nichiren and his followers now in the Latter Day of the Law, you should understand that, when one practices the Lotus Sutra under such circumstances, difficulties will arise, and these are to be looked on as [peace and comfort]\u201d (cf. OTT, 115).\n\n\u201cPeace and comfort\u201d are not usually the words that come to mind when we encounter difficulties or suffering. Normally, we would think of \u201cpeace and comfort\u201d as being found amid tranquil and secure circumstances. But that is not the source of true \u201cpeace and comfort.\u201d\n\nWhen we strive in Buddhist practice for the sake of the happiness of ourselves and others in the Latter Day of the Law, obstacles are certain to arise. True peace and comfort are attained by facing obstacles and challenging hardships head-on. Experiencing difficulties is proof that we are making great efforts to persevere in faith.\n\nWhen a boat sets out on a long journey, it is bound to encounter fierce storms and powerful waves. But unless it weathers them and presses on, it cannot reach the \u201charbor\u201d of its destination.\n\nFor us, the harbor we aim for is Buddhahood. If we fear the storms of hardship and the raging waves of difficulty we may encounter along the way, we cannot reach our goal of Buddhahood.\n\nIn short, faith is a battle between the Buddha and devilish functions, and the only way to realize true peace and comfort is to develop, through that struggle, a strong life state that will not be defeated by difficulties.\n\nWhat I would like you to bear deeply in mind is that a state of absolute peace and comfort that no obstacle can destroy comes from establishing strong faith that can withstand any adversity.\n\nIn the long course of your lives, you may experience setbacks or failures. But I hope you will never allow yourselves to be discouraged or defeated. Live out your lives as lion kings! Faith means to have unflagging hope. May each of you always forge ahead with courage and wisdom as you strive to fulfill the great vow for kosen-rufu.\n\nFrom a speech at a Hyogo Prefecture representative leaders meeting, Hyogo, April 18, 1987.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.5]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.7]"}, {"title": "chapter-15-7.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.7]\n15.7 Obstacles Enable Us to Polish Our Lives\nStressing that hardships and obstacles enable us to polish our lives, President Ikeda explains that the very circumstances that trouble us help us reveal our Buddhahood.\n\nObstacles enable us to polish our lives.\n\nIn one of his writings, the Daishonin employs the following simile: \u201cIt will only be like a boar rubbing against the golden mountain\u201d (WND-1, 770).\n\nThe story behind this simile goes something like this: Once there was a golden mountain. A boar came upon it and didn\u2019t like the fact that the mountain glittered brightly. It tried to erase the golden mountain\u2019s brilliance by rubbing against it. The boar\u2019s coat was stiff, and he rubbed very hard. But what was the result? The harder the boar rubbed against the mountain, the brighter it shone.\n\nThis simile appears in The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom and in Great Concentration and Insight.\n\nThe Daishonin refers to it to teach us that the more that practitioners of the Lotus Sutra encounter obstacles, the brighter their lives shine.\n\nThe obstacles in question are the three obstacles and four devils.*1 We cannot attain enlightenment without struggling against them. We cannot become Buddhas without experiencing and overcoming difficulties\u2014just as we cannot graduate from university without taking examinations and passing them.\n\nThe Daishonin writes: \u201cThis world is the domain of the devil king of the sixth heaven\u201d*2 (WND-1, 495). As a result, good people are harassed and evil people do what they like. Kosen-rufu is a movement to fundamentally transform this upside-down state of affairs.\n\nTo shine ever more brightly the more obstacles we face\u2014this also provides an important lesson in the area of human relations.\n\nAn organization is a gathering of all kinds of individuals. There may be some who are not easy to work with. Sometimes, the behavior of others may really annoy or upset us. But such things make the golden mountain of our lives shine.\n\nIf everyone in our lives was perfect, we would never grow. Working together with people we may not get along well with is a way to polish our \u201cgolden mountain.\u201d\n\nQuite frankly, we ourselves may not always behave as admirably as we\u2019d like, so how can we expect others to behave just as we want them to? Getting upset at each little incident doesn\u2019t improve anything, nor does it change the other person. Sometimes you just have to sigh and think, \u201cWell, that\u2019s the way he is,\u201d and accept the other person with compassion.\n\nThe Daishonin writes: \u201cThe fifth volume of [T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai\u2019s] Great Concentration and Insight states, \u2018. . . like the various rivers flowing into the sea; like logs making a fire burn more briskly\u2019\u201d (WND-1, 770).\n\nT\u2019ien-t\u2019ai is saying that the reason the sea is so vast is that many different rivers flow into it, and the sea accepts them all.\n\nIf the sea rejected one river or another, it wouldn\u2019t be the great, vast sea it is. If we reject and avoid people we don\u2019t like, we can\u2019t develop a self that is as vast and expansive as the ocean.\n\nT\u2019ien-t\u2019ai also says that the more logs we add to a fire, the more briskly it burns.\n\nThe logs of unhappiness fuel the flames of happiness. Because we experience hardships, we can know joy. Buddhism teaches that the sufferings of earthly desires lead to enlightenment. Problems enable us to grow. That\u2019s why there is no such thing as unalloyed or unremitting happiness.\n\nThe Daishonin even says that Hei no Saemon-no-jo and others who had persecuted him are his \u201cforemost good friends\u201d and \u201cbest allies\u201d (cf. WND-1, 770). Those who give us the hardest time are those who, more than anyone else, help us attain Buddhahood.\n\nFrom a speech at a women\u2019s division representatives conference, Tokyo, January 25, 1998.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Three obstacles and four devils: Various obstacles and hindrances to the practice of Buddhism.

The situation was so dire that Mr. Toda even stepped down from his position as Soka Gakkai general director [to protect the organization from being embroiled in his business problems]. He was unable to pay his employees, who quit one after another, until I was left as his sole support.\n\nMr. Toda was a great leader of kosen-rufu. Firmly convinced that protecting him was the equivalent of protecting the Soka Gakkai and the heritage of faith of Nichiren Buddhism, I did everything I possibly could to assist and support him.\n\nOne day, Mr. Toda and I were on our way to Omiya City in Saitama Prefecture, hoping to gain the financial means to break through the impasse that Mr. Toda\u2019s businesses were facing. Unfortunately, our effort did not meet with success.\n\nOn the way back, we walked along the banks of the Arakawa River in Omiya. The night wind was cold. The stars above were beautiful, shining down upon the two of us, mentor and disciple, who had failed in our attempt that day.\n\nThe laces of my worn shoes, which had several holes, came undone. As I retied them, I began singing a popular song, hoping to cheer Mr. Toda up.\n\nI humorously changed the lyric, \u201cIn the flow of the stars . . . , who turned me into this kind of woman\u201d into \u201cIn the flow of the stars . . . , who turned me into this kind of man?\u201d\n\nWith a smile, Mr. Toda swiftly rejoined: \u201cI did!\u201d\n\nIn the midst of a genuinely desperate situation, he retained his sense of humor.\n\nI was relieved. In fact, I was happy. As long as Mr. Toda was alive and well, there was nothing to fear. Rather, knowing this inspired me, his disciple, to keep fighting my hardest, to carry on the struggle until we had won.\n\nThat unforgettable moment, that drama of mentor and disciple\u2014a pivotal event unfolding under the starry skies of Saitama\u2014remains indelibly etched in my heart to this day.\n\nMr. Toda would often say to me: \u201cAn impasse is a critical turning point. Do you give up and throw in the towel? Or do you stand up with indomitable resolve, determined to go on fighting? That difference in attitude is what determines victory or defeat.\u201d Mr. Toda deeply and firmly impressed this lesson on me.\n\n\u201cListen to me, Daisaku. Whatever happens along the way, triumph in the end! Resolve to win! If you win in the end, you will have won in everything.\u201d\n\nMy days back then were a continuous, intense struggle. I had no time for self-pity. I knew in the depths of my being that an eternal, ever-victorious, indestructible bastion was being built within me as I strove tirelessly to support my mentor with the spirit of exerting millions of eons of effort (cf. OTT, 214).\n\nFrom the resonance of our spirits as mentor and disciple and in the light of the uncompromising law of cause and effect taught in Buddhism\u2014I was strongly convinced that I would experience brilliant future reward.\n\nEventually, we made our way through this raging storm of troubles [relating to Mr. Toda\u2019s business problems], and on May 3 the following year [1951], the morning of victory dawned as Mr. Toda was inaugurated as the second Soka Gakkai president.\n\nIt is only when we struggle against adversity that the tremendous power residing in the very depths of our lives begins to reveal itself. Those who can summon great strength at the most challenging time are victors. This is an unchanging rule of history.\n\nFrom an essay series \u201cThoughts on The New Human Revolution,\u201d published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, December 6, 2003.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.7]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.9]"}, {"title": "chapter-15-9.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.9]\n15.9 The Stronger One\u2019s Faith, the Greater One\u2019s Joy\nPresident Ikeda shares passages from Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s writings that he has taken to heart since his youth, and calls upon us to have strong faith and rejoice in adversity.\n\n\u201cA Ship to Cross the Sea of Suffering\u201d is one of the writings of Nichiren Daishonin that I engraved so deeply in my life as a youth that I could recite it by heart.\n\nIn it, the Daishonin writes: \u201cIn the Latter Day of the Law, the votary of the Lotus Sutra will appear without fail. The greater the hardships befalling him, the greater the delight he feels, because of his strong faith. Doesn\u2019t a fire burn more briskly when logs are added?\u201d (WND-1, 33). Here, he states that the votary of the Lotus Sutra is destined to appear in the Latter Day of the Law, with the implicit message that it is he who is fulfilling this prediction. Hardships will befall the votary, he notes, but that is precisely the time to rouse even stronger faith and relish the challenge of overcoming them.\n\nThe votary of the Lotus Sutra welcomes hardships, eagerly awaits them, and then rises joyfully to challenge them. True, courageous Bodhisattvas of the Earth*1 do not react to a little criticism by feeling sad, whining, doubting, or complaining.\n\nThe Daishonin likens rousing even stronger faith when we encounter hardships to a fire burning more brightly when logs are added. But if a fire is small, it won\u2019t be able to burn the logs; adding them would only extinguish it.\n\nHe also writes, describing the votary\u2019s vast and encompassing life state: \u201cAll rivers flow into the sea, but does the sea turn back their waters? The currents of hardship pour into the sea of the Lotus Sutra and rush against its votary. The river is not rejected by the ocean; nor does the votary reject suffering\u201d (WND-1, 33).\n\nThose who feel rising joy when they face great hardships are true votaries of the Lotus Sutra who are like the sea. They possess within them the infinitely vast ocean of a fearless, unshakable, and all-embracing state of life.\n\nNext, the Daishonin writes: \u201cWere it not for the flowing rivers, there would be no sea. Likewise, without tribulation there would be no votary of the Lotus Sutra\u201d (WND-1, 33).\n\nWhatever difficulties we may encounter, they are nothing compared to those experienced by the Daishonin. Moreover, the hardships we undergo in the course of our Buddhist practice all contribute to helping us transform our karma. They ultimately have profound meaning for our lives. They are all nourishment for our development, for leading brilliant, worthwhile lives. They are the driving force that propels us toward lives of towering victory.\n\nThis is the great privilege that you, my friends who embrace the Mystic Law, enjoy, and a truth that you should devote your lives to demonstrating.\n\nFrom a speech at a representative leaders meeting commemorating the 40th anniversary of kosen-rufu in Izu, Shizuoka, November 23, 1987.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Bodhisattvas of the Earth: An innumerable host of bodhisattvas who emerge from beneath the earth and to whom Shakyamuni Buddha entrusts the propagation of the Mystic Law, or the essence of the Lotus Sutra, in the Latter Day of the Law.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.8]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.10]"}, {"title": "chapter-15-10.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.10]\n15.10 Not Giving In to Doubt When Difficulties Arise\nReferring to an important passage from Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s writing \u201cThe Opening of the Eyes,\u201d President Ikeda explains that the life state of Buddhahood is attained by facing and overcoming obstacles through faith.\n\nLet\u2019s examine a passage from Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s writing \u201cThe Opening of the Eyes\u201d:\n\n\u201cAlthough I and my disciples may encounter various difficulties, if we do not harbor doubts in our hearts, we will as a matter of course attain Buddhahood. Do not have doubts simply because heaven does not lend you protection. Do not be discouraged because you do not enjoy an easy and secure existence in this life. This is what I have taught my disciples morning and evening, and yet they begin to harbor doubts and abandon their faith. Foolish men are likely to forget the promises they have made when the crucial moment comes.\u201d (WND-1, 283)\n\nIf you remember this, you\u2019ll be fine. Please never forget this teaching.\n\nThose who keep on striving, never doubting the power of faith even when difficulties arise, are certain to attain Buddhahood, the Daishonin assures us.\n\nI know that many of you have memorized this passage, and that it has been placed on the Buddhist altar in many households. It is one of the most fundamental of the Daishonin\u2019s teachings.\n\nDifficulties are inescapable. \u201cNo one can avoid problems, not even sages or worthies\u201d (WND-1, 681), says the Daishonin.\n\nSince we cannot avoid them, we must overcome them. We must overcome them and attain Buddhahood.\n\nIn \u201cLetter from Sado,\u201d the Daishonin writes: \u201cIron, when heated in the flames and pounded, becomes a fine sword. Worthies and sages are tested by abuse\u201d (WND-1, 303). Swords are tempered in fire. That\u2019s the only way to make a sword.\n\nIn the same way, those who are tempered by criticism and abuse, by opposition and attack, become true \u201csages and worthies.\u201d\n\nFrom a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Tokyo, September 29, 1994.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.9]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.11]"}, {"title": "chapter-15-11.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.11]\n15.11 Difficulties Are Opportunities for Transforming Our Karma\nPresident Ikeda explains the Buddhist principle of \u201cchanging poison into medicine\u201d and urges us to view difficulties as opportunities for transforming our karma.\n\nDo we allow difficulties to overwhelm us, or do we fight back and triumph over them? That is the crux of our struggle both as individuals and societies.\n\nThe Buddhist principle of \u201cchanging poison into medicine\u201d*1 opened the way for all people to enact joyous dramas of inner transformation. Not only could they surmount the hardships confronting them, but also dramatically transform adverse circumstances and elevate their life state to new heights.\n\nReferring to The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom and T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai\u2019s Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra, Nichiren Daishonin declared for the sake of all people living in the corrupt age of the Latter Day of the Law: \u201cWhat does it mean to change poison into medicine? It means to transform the three paths [of earthly desires, karma, and suffering]*2 into the three virtues: the Dharma body, wisdom, and emancipation\u201d*3 (WND-2, 743). In other words, the supreme power of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo enables us to transform any deluded impulse, any karma, and any suffering into Buddhahood, wisdom, and benefit. There is no negative karma that we cannot change. This fact is a brilliant source of hope, so we need not lament or despair.\n\nThe two Ikegami brothers endured their father disinheriting the elder brother on account of their faith in the Lotus Sutra. Shijo Kingo, meanwhile, faced the prospect of having his estates confiscated by his lord. The lies and scheming of malicious priests lay behind both these developments, which, in the feudal society of the day, threatened the very livelihoods of these disciples.\n\nThe Daishonin, however, advised the Ikegami brothers: \u201cYou must persevere through this trial and see for yourselves the blessings of the Lotus Sutra\u201d (WND-1, 498). And he encouraged Shijo Kingo: \u201cGreat disaster without fail changes into great fortune\u201d (WND-1, 824).\n\nMoving beyond questions of whether the disinheritance would be rescinded or the estates restored, the Daishonin revealed the path leading directly from the worst possible situation to the highest peak of victory.\n\nThe Ikegami brothers followed the Daishonin\u2019s advice, and in the end, they succeeded in overcoming their father\u2019s fierce opposition. They eventually even converted him to the Daishonin\u2019s teachings and managed to establish family harmony that would lead to lasting prosperity.\n\nShijo Kingo, too, demonstrated undeniable proof of the power of faith. He overcame his lord\u2019s prejudice and won his support and understanding. In addition, he came to earn praise throughout Kamakura, with people declaring: \u201cNo one can compare to Nakatsukasa Saemon-no-jo [Shijo Kingo]\u201d and \u201cAh, there\u2019s a fine fellow . . . !\u201d (WND-2, 730).\n\nIn the northern regions of Japan, after the bitter cold of winter, spring explodes onto the scene. Similarly, disciples who persevere through the harshest winters of life with courageous faith, in the same spirit as their mentor, will savor a bright springtime of victory beyond their imagination. That is the ultimate meaning of \u201cchanging poison into medicine.\u201d\n\nPresident Toda encouraged a member who was struggling with problems: \u201cRejoice when you encounter hardships! It is the time to demonstrate the power of faith. It is an opportunity to transform your karma. Buddhism teaches the infallible Law of \u2018changing poison into medicine.\u2019 You can regain any losses tenfold or a hundredfold in the form of great benefit.\u201d\n\nIt has been the painful fate of human society, plagued and terrorized by the world\u2019s many poisons, to be trapped in an endless cycle of misfortune and confusion. Our Soka movement is dedicated to spreading the humanistic principles of Nichiren Buddhism for the peace and prosperity of all humanity. As such, it is engaged in a fearless struggle to change all poison into medicine, freely creating value out of everything for the sake of human happiness, protecting the sanctity of life, and world peace.\n\nFrom an editorial titled \u201cThe Joyous Drama of Changing Poison into Medicine,\u201d published in Japanese in the Daibyakurenge, April 2010.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Changing poison into medicine: The principle that earthly desires and suffering can be transformed into benefit and enlightenment by virtue of the power of the Mystic Law. This phrase is found in a passage from The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom, which mentions \u201ca great physician who can change poison into medicine.\u201d\n*2Three paths of earthly desires, karma, and suffering: They are called \u201cpaths\u201d because one leads to the other. Earthly desires, which include greed, anger, foolishness, arrogance, and doubt, give rise to actions that create evil karma. The effect of this evil karma then manifests itself as suffering. Suffering aggravates earthly desires, leading to further misguided action, which in turn brings on more evil karma and suffering. In this way, the three paths function to prevent a person from attaining Buddhahood.\n*3Three virtues of the Dharma body, wisdom, and emancipation: Three attributes of a Buddha. The Dharma body means the truth that the Buddha has realized, or the true aspect of all phenomena; wisdom is the capacity to realize this truth; and emancipation means the state of being free from the sufferings of birth and death.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.10]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.12]"}, {"title": "chapter-15-12.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 15: \u201cFaith for Overcoming Obstacles\u201d [15.12]\n15.12 A Buddha Is One Who Continues Striving\nPresident Ikeda discusses the important defining qualities of a Buddha and how Shakyamuni attained Buddhahood.\n\nThose who continue to strive and overcome hardships will attain Buddhahood. This is a very important point.\n\nWhat is a Buddha? And how did Shakyamuni attain Buddhahood?\n\nHajime Nakamura, a leading scholar of Buddhism, has this to say on the subject: \u201cEven after becoming a Buddha (an \u2018enlightened one\u2019), Shakyamuni remained a human being.\u201d*1\n\nEven after attaining Buddhahood, Shakyamuni still experienced pain and suffering. He knew illness. He continued to be tempted by negative influences or impulses.\n\nProfessor Nakamura continues: \u201cThe essence of Buddhahood, then, must be identified as the practice of rejecting temptation. Unceasing, assiduous effort is itself the practice of the Buddha. When one attains enlightenment, one does not become some different kind of being called a \u2018Buddha.\u2019\u201d*2\n\nThe \u201ctemptation\u201d of which Professor Nakamura speaks here refers to negative influences or impulses and bad friends. They are the forces that obstruct Buddhist practice, lead to unhappiness, destroy the harmonious unity of believers, and tempt us to abandon our faith.\n\nThe person who wages an unceasing battle against such devilish influences and continuously acts to lead others to happiness is a Buddha. A Buddha is not some special sort of being. The person who keeps striving bravely in both spirit and action, who keeps up the battle against negative forces until it is won\u2014that person is a Buddha.\n\nShakyamuni\u2019s attainment of enlightenment under the bodhi tree in ancient India and Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s act of casting off his transient status and revealing his true identity as the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law at the time of the Tatsunokuchi Persecution*3 are both expressions of the highest state of humanity. Neither Shakyamuni nor the Daishonin ceased to be human. The essential truth of Buddhism is that ordinary people can attain the ultimate state of Buddhahood as they are.\n\nIt is in the faith of those who exert themselves in their Buddhist practice and actively make efforts to realize kosen-rufu that Buddhahood reveals itself.\n\nToday, all of you are striving in Soka Gakkai activities, taking on the sufferings of many people as your own sufferings. This is truly the noble behavior of Buddhas.\n\nNichiren Daishonin declares that one who perseveres through great hardships and embraces the Lotus Sutra from beginning to end is an emissary of the Buddha (cf. WND-1, 942).\n\nAs long as we devote ourselves to the cause of kosen-rufu, we are sure to encounter obstacles. But it is these very obstacles that enable us to strengthen our faith and forge the state of Buddhahood within us.\n\nFrom a speech at a Tohoku Region general meeting, Tokyo, March 21, 1994.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Translated from Japanese.

There was one hard straw mat, and the rest of the floor was wood. He had no heating. He had no Gohonzon. That January, Mr. Makiguchi wrote several letters to his family from this cold, spartan prison cell.\n\nIn one dated January 7, he wrote: \u201cI am fine, Sadako.*1 I have greeted my 74th New Year\u2019s here. For the three days of the New Year holiday we received pounded rice cakes and other delicious treats. Please take care of the family, and don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d*2\n\nIn 1944, Mr. Makiguchi would become 74 years old according to the traditional Japanese custom counting a person\u2019s age as one year from the day of birth. [He, in fact, turned 73 that year, according to the Western way of calculating age.] Incidentally, Nichimoku Shonin*3 was also 74 when he died on his way to remonstrate with the government authorities.\n\nMr. Makiguchi calls the plain prison fare \u201cdelicious.\u201d The amount was probably small, lacking in nutrition, and of the poorest quality, but he does not complain. We can see how serene and composed he is.\n\nHe also wrote: \u201cWhat I am going through is nothing compared to the sufferings of the Daishonin on Sado.\u201d*4 His standard of comparison for his time in prison was the persecution endured by the Daishonin. Compared to what the Daishonin suffered while in exile on Sado, his experience in prison is nothing serious, he declares. We are the successors of Mr. Makiguchi. I hope you will have this same spirit.\n\nWhat is the use in allowing ourselves to be disturbed by life\u2019s minor troubles and hardships? They are the fate of all human beings, and will never disappear completely. The four sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death are an inseparable part of human existence.\n\nA life that goes by without any hardships, problems, or sadness would be incredibly empty, shallow, and meaningless. The ultimate teaching of the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism is that earthly desires or sufferings lead to enlightenment. The greater our suffering and the deeper our pain, the greater the enlightenment and joy we will gain.\n\nOn January 7, Mr. Makiguchi also wrote: \u201cWhen you believe wholeheartedly in the Gohonzon, even if you suffer from a succession of ailments or troubles, you will be able to overcome them.\u201d*5 He is voicing his great conviction that though the three obstacles and four devils*6 are bound to arise when we exert ourselves assiduously in our Buddhist practice, we can definitely surmount them and turn poison into medicine if we remain steadfast in faith.\n\nTen days later, January 17, Mr. Makiguchi wrote: \u201cConcentrating utterly on my faith is my work at this time. As long as I do that, I have nothing to worry about. Depending upon one\u2019s state of mind, one can be completely safe even in hell.\u201d*7 [The prison censors blacked out the word \u201chell.\u201d]\n\nOn January 26, he wrote: \u201cDepending on one\u2019s state of mind, even hell can be enjoyable.\u201d*8 [This entire sentence was blacked out by the censors.]\n\nBecause of his lofty state of mind, Mr. Makiguchi\u2019s cold, dark prison cell became a safe, enjoyable place, a place where there was nothing to worry about. He had truly attained a calm and imperturbable state of mind\u2014reflecting the Buddhist principles that \u201chell is itself the Land of Tranquil Light*9\u201d and \u201cearthly desires are enlightenment,\u201d as described in the Daishonin\u2019s writings.\n\nThis was the magnificent faith and life state of the founder of the Soka Gakkai. Mr. Makiguchi was a person who deeply internalized the teachings of Nichiren Daishonin.\n\nWhen we consider what Mr. Makiguchi endured, all sufferings seem minor. There is no greater pride than being Mr. Makiguchi\u2019s successors.\n\nFrom a speech at a nationwide youth division leaders meeting, Tokyo, January 15, 1992.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Sadako refers to the wife of Mr. Makiguchi\u2019s third son, Yozo, who died in the war just prior to Mr. Makiguchi\u2019s death.\n*2Translated from Japanese.

He also stresses that we can tap our inherent power and potential through our struggles to overcome hardships.\n\nAt the time of the Tatsunokuchi Persecution,*1 Nichiren Daishonin discarded his transient status as an ordinary practitioner at the stage of hearing the name and words of the truth.*2 While remaining an ordinary person, he revealed his true identity as the Buddha of limitless joy enlightened since time without beginning.*3 Put another way, as an ordinary person, he manifested the eternal Thus Come One that is one with the eternal Mystic Law, the fundamental law of the universe.\n\nAfter casting off the transient and revealing the true in this way, the Daishonin took on his role as the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law. In that capacity, he began inscribing the Gohonzon in the form of a mandala as the object of fundamental respect or devotion and the foundation for all people\u2019s lives.\n\nIncidentally, we should note that in \u201ccasting off the transient,\u201d the Chinese character for \u201ccasting off\u201d also means \u201copening up.\u201d\n\nThe Daishonin manifested the Buddha of limitless joy as none other than an ordinary person. If we overlook this point, then we may incorrectly conclude that attaining Buddhahood means becoming something superior to and distinct from human beings. Nichiren Daishonin did not give up his life as an ordinary person. Rather, he brilliantly manifested the eternal Buddha within his life as an ordinary person.\n\nI want to note another important point. Namely, that this principle also applies to us. When we dedicate our lives to kosen-rufu, overcoming painful suffering and persevering in faith, we, too, can actualize the principle of \u201ccasting off the transient and revealing the true.\u201d As ordinary people, we can bring forth the same life state of Buddhahood as Nichiren Daishonin.\n\nHow fortunate we are to have encountered this teaching. If the goal were to become some sort of special, idealized superhuman being, then happiness in this life would be unattainable.\n\nNichiren Daishonin is the Buddha of the Latter Day precisely because he showed that all people have the potential to attain Buddhahood and revealed the means for doing so. He demonstrated for us through his own life that an ordinary person can attain Buddhahood in this lifetime.\n\n\u201cCasting off the transient and revealing the true\u201d means each of us establishing a solid self that can surmount all difficulties, break through fundamental ignorance,*4 and express our inherently enlightened nature, the Dharma nature.*5 Becoming people whose Buddhahood shines forth ever more brightly the greater the challenges we face is the path to attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime.\n\nIn that respect, the key to true self-development is to exert ourselves in faith, in our Buddhist practice, to overcome all obstacles.\n*\nWe don\u2019t take on difficulties only after deepening our faith. Instead, by facing difficulties we can polish our lives and develop invincible, diamond-like faith. Whatever problems we have, we should chant honestly about them to the Gohonzon. Through chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we will find a way to overcome them. This difference in the order of things may seem subtle, but it is decisive.\n\nAs we strive to fulfill our unique missions, we inevitably encounter difficulties. But as long as our hearts remain steadfast and our faith firm, there is no hardship we cannot surmount, no ordeal that we cannot break through. We inherently possess immeasurable power. That is the power of the Buddha of limitless joy enlightened since time without beginning. Therefore, the more we challenge ourselves, the more power we can bring forth. Faith enables us to tap this hidden treasure. Great hardships are springboards to profound awakening and mean we are certain to attain Buddhahood.\n\nThe Daishonin taught his disciples this way of life through personally triumphing over each of the great difficulties and persecutions he faced. During the Tatsunokuchi Persecution, in particular, he clearly outlined the ultimate essence of this way of life to Shijo Kingo. He did so not only for his disciple\u2019s sake, but for the sake of posterity.\n\nShijo Kingo remained steadfast in faith throughout. As a result, mentor and disciple together could attain the fruit of Buddhahood. Tatsunokuchi itself became the Land of Tranquil Light.*6\n\nThe \u201ctransient\u201d to be cast off is weakness and cowardice. The Daishonin, by revealing his \u201ctrue identity\u201d of courage, demonstrated for all people the principle of \u201ccasting off the transient and revealing the true.\u201d\n\nWhen we act with the same courageous resolve and spirit as the Daishonin and calmly confront the hardships we encounter, we will actualize our own \u201ccasting off the transient and revealing the true.\u201d\n\nFrom The World of Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s Writings, vol. 2, published in Japanese in January 2004.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Tatsunokuchi Persecution: The failed attempt, instigated by powerful government figures, to behead the Daishonin under the cover of darkness on the beach at Tatsunokuchi, on the outskirts of Kamakura, on September 12, 1271.\n*2Ordinary practitioner at the stage of hearing the name and words of the truth: An ordinary person who has taken the first step in Buddhist practice, that of accepting and understanding the words of the Buddha\u2019s teachings, and who has not yet gained any results or effects of practice.

This, he stressed, was vital for the Soka Gakkai as a whole to \u201ccast off the transient and reveal the true.\u201d\n\nIn May 1951, after surmounting his business troubles and becoming second president, Josei Toda proclaimed: \u201cThe Soka Gakkai has \u2018cast off the transient and revealed the true\u2019!\u201d*1 This, he explained, was because Soka Gakkai members as a whole had gained a deep awareness of their identity as Bodhisattvas of the Earth*2 and stood up to take part in the struggle for kosen-rufu.*3\n\nWhile imprisoned, Mr. Toda realized that he was a Bodhisattva of the Earth. At first, it was his personal awakening. But, later, disciples who shared this sense of mission as Bodhisattvas of the Earth rose to take action alongside him.\n\nThe \u201ccasting off the transient and revealing the true\u201d of the disciples is central to the \u201ccasting off the transient and revealing the true\u201d of the Soka Gakkai.\n\nMr. Toda emphasized: \u201cCome to understand your life\u2019s mission by actually putting the Daishonin\u2019s teachings into practice! Understanding your mission intellectually and understanding it through real experience are two different things entirely.\u201d\n\nJust one disciple who strives with the same heart as the mentor can galvanize everyone. I fought furiously as that one true disciple. I supported my mentor, broadened the great struggle for kosen-rufu, and opened the path to victory. I led the way to achieving Mr. Toda\u2019s cherished membership goal of 750,000 households during his lifetime. I actualized his grand vision for promoting peace, culture, and education, and I spread our movement\u2019s great philosophy and ideals throughout the world. The disciple who \u201ccast off the transient and revealed the true,\u201d just as his mentor instructed, built today\u2019s flourishing Soka Gakkai.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s someone who always achieves what he says he will\u201d\u2014this was Mr. Toda\u2019s evaluation of me, and I regard it as a source of pride and honor.\n\nFor what reason have we been born? Why are we alive? When we deeply recognize our fundamental mission in life, we can bring forth immeasurably great power.\n\nThoughtful individuals around the world have been taking note of our efforts to empower people, especially the youth. Former UN Under-Secretary-General Anwarul K. Chowdhury is one of them. He has praised our organization for bringing out the best in each individual through our conviction that all people possess the capacity to overcome even the greatest difficulties.*4\n\nI want to proclaim that the time has come once again for the Soka Gakkai to \u201ccast off the transient and reveal the true.\u201d\n\nI say to you, my friends: \u201cTake up fresh challenges as if you\u2019ve been completely reborn!\u201d \u201cBe lions!

The important thing is what you do from now. Are you going to be discouraged and allow yourselves to fall into despair? Or will you regard this as an opportunity to show actual proof of our faith and rise up again courageously, determined not to be beaten? Your inner resolve is what decides your happiness or unhappiness.\n\n\u201cThroughout our lives, we are bound to face all kinds of adversity; not only natural disasters but things like bankruptcy, unemployment, illness, accidents, and the death of loved ones. No one\u2019s life is ever perfectly smooth.\n\n\u201cIn fact, life is an endless series of trials and tribulations, and it would be no exaggeration to say that facing difficulties is indeed what life is about. The question, then, is how to remain unbeaten by these trials and adorn our lives with victory. Buddhism teaches the concept of \u201cchanging poison into medicine.\u201d*1 According to this principle, we can change even the worst circumstances into benefit and happiness through faith. We need to be utterly confident of this.\n\n\u201cFrom another perspective, this principle is saying that to attain the \u2018medicine\u2019 of Buddhahood, of absolute happiness, we must triumph over the \u2018poison\u2019 of suffering. In other words, suffering is the seed that enables the flower of happiness to bloom. As such, we shouldn\u2019t be afraid of hardships. Rather, we should face them with courage.\n\n\u201cWe are all Bodhisattvas of the Earth*2 who possess the life state of Buddhahood. We have appeared in this world to lead all people of the Latter Day of the Law to enlightenment. We will never be deadlocked. Adverse circumstances do not cause unhappiness; it is caused by our own despair and negativity.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to realize that the suffering you are experiencing now has profound significance. If all of you affected by this natural disaster splendidly rebuild your lives, you will have turned poison into medicine and demonstrated the greatness of Nichiren Buddhism to society. That is the purpose of the struggles you are now facing.\n\n\u201cPlease relay the following message from me to all your fellow members: \u2018Don\u2019t be defeated. I hope you will surmount this obstacle and come out victorious.

In recent decades, Japan experienced two particularly catastrophic events\u2014the 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake affecting the Kansai region and the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami.\n\nAfter the former, President Ikeda, who was scheduled to deliver an important lecture overseas, postponed his departure to remain in Japan to support those affected by the disaster. Even after departing, he continued to write messages for those members during his flight. After his lecture, he returned immediately to Japan and went straight to the Kansai area, where he took the lead in offering support and encouragement. Similarly, after the Tohoku disaster, he sent countless messages to members throughout the affected regions.\n\nThe following selected messages also offer encouragement for all those affected by the tragedy of natural disasters around the world.\n\n[After the Great Hanshin Earthquake]\n\nSince the earthquake that devastated Kobe and surrounding areas last month [on January 17, 1995], I have been praying daily for all who lost their lives. I have been chanting not only for Soka Gakkai members, but also for everyone in the region.\n\nNichiren Daishonin says of a disciple who had died: \u201cWhen he was alive, he was a Buddha in life, and now he is a Buddha in death. He is a Buddha in both life and death\u201d (WND-1, 456).\n\nPlease rest assured that your deceased loved ones are watching over you and your families, and are sure to be reborn speedily.\n\nWhat\u2019s important is that those of us who are alive remain hopeful and become happy. Because of the oneness of life and death, our happiness imparts joy to our deceased loved ones and, at the same time, serves as proof that they dwell in a life state of Buddhahood. On the other hand, when we allow grief to defeat us, it saddens our departed loved ones. Always remember, we are all Buddhas in both life and death. We are always together and one.\n\nBuddhism teaches the principle of \u201cchanging poison into medicine.\u201d*1\n\nOur faith is anchored in the conviction that \u201cwhen great evil occurs, great good follows\u201d (WND-1, 1119).\n\nThe Lotus Sutra guarantees that \u201cwinter always turns to spring\u201d (WND-1, 536).\n\nThe teaching of the Mystic Law is for the present and the future.\n\nTreasuring each day of our lives, aware how precious it is, is a way of living that accords with the true spirit of Buddhism.\n\nNichiren Daishonin teaches: \u201cLife is the foremost of all treasures\u201d (WND-1, 1125). I hope that as long as you live, you will always be able to feel in your hearts what a precious treasure life is\u2014more wondrous than all the treasures in the universe. And, please remember, it is the power of faith in the Mystic Law that makes that treasure shine with boundless brilliance.\n\nThe Daishonin also asserts: \u201cA hundred years of practice in the Land of Perfect Bliss cannot compare to the benefit gained from one day\u2019s practice in the impure world\u201d (WND-1, 736). Practicing Buddhism just a single day in this \u201cimpure world\u201d filled with suffering, he says, brings greater benefit than doing so for a whole century in the Land of Perfect Bliss, a realm free of pain and sorrows.\n\nThe Daishonin is speaking of the immense benefit of Buddhist practice in the Latter Day of the Law, and his words underscore how noble it is to strive in a place that is so challenging and demanding.\n\nLife is about challenge and effort. Each day of our lives as Soka Gakkai members brings tremendous fulfillment and immeasurable benefit.\n\nFrom a discussion with Kansai Region representatives, published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, February 6, 1995.\n\n[In 2000, five years after the Great Hanshin Earthquake, President Ikeda visited the Nagata Culture Center in Kobe\u2019s Nagata Ward, one of the areas most seriously damaged in that disaster. He led a memorial gongyo service, offering prayers for those who died in the earthquake, and warmly encouraged members. He also played the piano, performing the tune \u201cDainanko,\u201d which has deep ties to the area.]\n\nI am amazed by the extent to which Nagata has recovered! Though I\u2019m sure there are still many trying challenges ahead of you.\n\nI will continue to support you. I will chant daimoku for you as long as I live.\n\nPlease be confident that all your fellow members and loved ones who died in the disaster will rejoin the movement for kosen-rufu without fail.\n\nLife is a struggle. It is a struggle to become happy. But happiness is not simply the absence of hardships. Buddhism teaches that the sufferings we experience as human beings lead us to enlightenment. The Daishonin writes: \u201cThere is no true happiness for human beings other than chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u201d (WND-1, 681).\n\nEveryone has problems and worries. Everyone meets with misfortune. And the greatest of life\u2019s sufferings is death. Death is the inescapable destiny\u2014the karma if you will\u2014of humankind. Remember, however, that when we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and strive for kosen-rufu, our lives embody the Mystic Law. Our practice of Nichiren Buddhism enables us to forge a solid, invincible self and develop the ability and strength to overcome any difficulty or misfortune with serenity. When we die, our lives merge back into the life of the universe and, in rhythm with the Mystic Law, continue to advance on the path of happiness.\n\nThe Mystic Law gives us the energy to live our lives to the fullest. The Daishonin assures us that those who embrace the Mystic Law \u201cwill grow younger\u201d (WND-1, 464). May the final chapter of your lives, therefore, be bright and vibrant, just like the rich colors of harvest or a glorious sunset.\n\nThe Daishonin states: \u201cNam-myoho-renge-kyo is the greatest of all joys\u201d (OTT, 212). Please be cheerful! None are stronger than those who are cheerful. Please live with a spirit of fortitude to make it through all things.\n\nLet\u2019s live out our lives together!\n\nI am always chanting daimoku for you. See you again!\n\nFrom a speech at a memorial gongyo service at the Nagata Culture Center, Hyogo, February 29, 2000.\n*\n[After the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami]\n\nI offer my sincerest condolences to everyone affected by the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck Tohoku five days ago [on March 11, 2011], leaving many people still missing and unaccounted for. I can only imagine your exhaustion. My wife, Kaneko, and I, along with the members throughout Japan and the world, are chanting daimoku for you with all our hearts. We are earnestly praying for your health and well-being and that all Buddhas and bodhisattvas thoroughly protect you.\n\nI also wish to express my heartfelt appreciation to those of you who are devoting yourselves selflessly to rescue and relief efforts, or in other ways are acting as pillars of support for your communities during this difficult time. Takuboku Ishikawa, a renowned youthful poet who hailed from Tohoku declared: \u201cHelping one person is a far greater achievement than becoming the ruler of a country.\u201d*2 You all have my deepest respect and gratitude.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes that even if we meet with disasters and calamities, they cannot destroy our heart or mind, the inner essence of life (cf. WND-2, 135). Nothing can destroy the treasures of the heart. Every adversity is but a trial to overcome so that we can attain eternal happiness. Our practice of Nichiren Buddhism, our faith in the Mystic Law, enables us to change all poison into medicine without fail.\n\nI am offering solemn prayers for all your loved ones\u2014family members and friends\u2014who have lost their lives. It is truly heartbreaking. Life, however, is eternal, and through chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we can transcend the bounds of life and death to connect with those who have passed away. Your deceased loved ones and friends, who through you share a profound connection with the Mystic Law, will definitely be embraced by the heavenly deities, attain Buddhahood, and be reborn quickly somewhere close to you. That is an essential teaching of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nDuring the Daishonin\u2019s lifetime, the great earthquake of the Shoka era (August 1257) caused unprecedented damage. Grieved by the people\u2019s pain and suffering, and amid ongoing great calamities, the Daishonin began to write his treatise \u201cOn Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land,\u201d thereby raising the banner of peace and justice for all humankind. He assures us: \u201cWhen great evil occurs, great good follows\u201d (WND-1, 1119).\n\nToday, March 16, is the day that my mentor, second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda, entrusted his youthful successors with carrying on the work of kosen-rufu in order to eradicate misery from the face of the earth. Now, let us triumphantly overcome this great disaster by further strengthening our vow for kosen-rufu while wholeheartedly supporting and encouraging one another.\n\nI am fervently praying and calling out to each of you: \u201cNever be defeated! Have courage! Have hope!\u201d\n\nFrom a message sent to Tohoku members after the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, March 16, 2011.\n*\n[On the second anniversary of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, President Ikeda paid tribute to the members who were striving valiantly to rebuild their lives in the disaster\u2019s aftermath.]\n\nWhat the unprecedented disaster of the March 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami destroyed was as precious as all the treasures of the universe.\n\nUnimaginable numbers of lives were lost. Everyone wishes that their beloved family members, close friends, and fellow members could be returned to them and their dear hometowns restored.\n\nImmediately after the disaster, my heart torn with sorrow, I assured our members in the affected areas that, based on the unerring principles of Buddhism, nothing can destroy the treasures of the heart.\n\nI am deeply moved by how you, my friends in Tohoku, have managed to survive and go on living with such perseverance and fortitude. That you have done so itself attests to your incredibly noble and wondrous mission.\n\nAs you continue to live bravely, your departed loved ones will live on with you in your hearts, transcending life and death.\n\nNichiren Daishonin solemnly writes: \u201cI do not know how long I or anyone else may live, but without fail, I will be with you at the time of your death and guide you from this life to the next\u201d (WND-1, 965).\n\nWith his compassionate gaze, the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law, Nichiren Daishonin, is watching over all of you who have so admirably managed to go on with life, and over your deceased fellow members and loved ones. He is resolutely protecting every one of you, without exception.\n\nAs practitioners who uphold the eternal Mystic Law, ours is a wondrous journey of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity\u2014always together with the Daishonin in both life and death!\n\nFrom an essay series \u201cOur Brilliant Path to Victory,\u201d published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, March 11, 2013.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Changing poison into medicine: The principle that earthly desires and suffering can be transformed into benefit and enlightenment by virtue of the power of the Mystic Law.

Having faith that a new day will arrive, he said, is the spirit of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nAll sorts of difficulties and obstacles invariably arise in the course of carrying out our human revolution. President Ikeda repeatedly assures us that by squarely facing and fearlessly challenging them, our inner Buddhahood, the wellspring of victory in life, will shine brightly.\n\nNichiren Buddhism stresses the importance of winning. Why is this so? What is it that we must win over? What are the requirements for leading a victorious life? This chapter features President Ikeda\u2019s guidance on this and other points, related to this important aspect of Buddhist philosophy.\n\nIn this selection, citing passages from the writings of Nichiren Daishonin, President Ikeda explains that the fundamental meaning of \u201cBuddhism is about winning\u201d is winning in the struggle between the Buddha nature and devilish functions in our own lives.\n\nThe teaching that \u201cBuddhism is about winning\u201d appears throughout the writings of Nichiren Daishonin. It is expressed in many different ways, but perhaps most clearly and succinctly in \u201cThe Hero of the World,\u201d a letter addressed to Shijo Kingo, one of his leading lay disciples, where the Daishonin writes: \u201cBuddhism primarily concerns itself with victory or defeat\u201d (WND-1, 835). Quoting this passage, Soka Gakkai founding president Tsunesaburo Makiguchi said that the confidence of demonstrating actual proof of victory is the very life of religion.*1\n\nBoth Buddhism and life are a struggle to be victorious. It is no exaggeration to say that Buddhism was taught to enable all people to win in the most fundamental struggle of life\u2014the struggle between the Buddha nature and devilish functions.\n\nEither we vanquish devilish functions and attain Buddhahood or we are defeated by them and lead lives of delusion. Ultimately, the purpose of our Buddhist practice is to realize victory in this crucial struggle.\n\nThis ultimate way of living articulated by Nichiren Buddhism views all aspects of life as a series of struggles that must be fought and won. This is the true reality of existence. For those who earnestly take on this challenge, everything that happens in life, even events in society, become part of their Buddhist practice. In other words, for them, the teaching that \u201cBuddhism is about winning\u201d applies to everything.\n\nThe Daishonin writes: \u201cA Buddha is looked up to as the Hero of the World\u201d (WND-1, 835). A \u201chero of the world\u201d is a person who is courageously engaged in the realities of life and society. A Buddha is one who intrepidly battles devilish functions and, manifesting the life force of the world of Buddhahood, leads a life of right action in human society.\n\nWhat the Daishonin was trying to teach Shijo Kingo, when he wrote that \u201cBuddhism primarily concerns itself with victory or defeat\u201d is that emulating the Buddha\u2019s way of life as a \u201chero of the world\u201d marks one as a genuine Buddhist practitioner.\n\nIf Buddhism is about winning, then how do we win? It is with our hearts, our minds.\n\nThe reason the Daishonin emphasizes that \u201cBuddhism is about winning\u201d is to drive home the importance of having the inner strength and fortitude to stand up to every obstacle and difficulty that arises in life. If we are fainthearted and timid, we cannot win over the negative functions in our own lives or in society.\n\nThe Daishonin writes: \u201cA coward cannot have any of his prayers answered\u201d (WND-1, 1001). This is the Daishonin\u2019s powerful encouragement to his disciples not to allow themselves to be defeated by life\u2019s ups and downs, nor to be undone by base negative influences. His teaching that \u201cnothing surpasses the strategy of the Lotus Sutra\u201d*2 expresses the same idea.\n\nFaith in the Lotus Sutra is not an intellectual or abstract theory. It must enable us to demonstrate practical wisdom for winning in society, in the real world.\n\nWith the heart of a lion king, the Daishonin fought one momentous battle after another, emerging triumphant each time. Such unwavering determination also activates the protective forces of the universe.\n\nIn a proud declaration of victory, he says: \u201cIt is because the heavenly deities came to my aid that I survived even the Tatsunokuchi Persecution*3 and emerged safely from other great persecutions*4\u201d (GZ, 843).*5\n\nOur lives, our daily existence, and society are constantly changing. Every change is either for better or for worse; there is no in-between. That is why it is essential that our faith, our Buddhist practice, enables us to win.\n\nFrom The World of Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s Writings, vol. 3, published in Japanese in March 2005.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Cf.

The idea that \u201cBuddhism is about winning\u201d is a call to us to win over ourselves\u2014over our limitations and our negative tendencies.\n\nI would like to discuss the assertion that Buddhism is about winning.\n\nMy mentor, second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda, who often gave guidance on this subject, said: \u201cFaith is a struggle against deadlock\u2014for the individual and for humanity. It is a struggle between the Buddha nature and devilish functions. That is the meaning of \u2018Buddhism is about winning.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere are bound to be times when we become stalled in our progress. That\u2019s when we need to chant and take action with even stronger determination. When we do so, we will definitely cultivate a more expansive state of life and be able to move forward once again. Continually repeating this process is the heart of our Buddhist practice.\n\nOur victory is determined by whether we win or lose in this struggle with ourselves, with stagnation, and with devilish functions.\n\nThose who neglect this fierce, unrelenting struggle with their inner weaknesses are already on the path of decline. They treat life like a game. Such complacency is the very hallmark of defeat.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cBuddhism primarily concerns itself with victory or defeat, while secular authority is based on the principle of reward and punishment. For this reason, a Buddha is looked up to as the Hero of the World, while a king is called the one who rules at his will.\u201d (WND-1, 835)\n\nRewards and punishments can be measured by degree and are relative by nature. For example, one can score 10 or 60 out of 100 on an exam, or receive awards of various rankings. In this way, rewards and punishments can be compared with one another as better or worse, because they are relative.\n\nBut victory and defeat are absolute. You either win or you lose. There is no middle ground. A Buddha is one who has achieved victory. A \u201chero of the world\u201d\u2014one of the titles of the Buddha\u2014is an unrivalled champion in the human world, in society.\n\nVarious Buddhist scriptures give the Buddha similar names, such as \u201cVictory in Battle,\u201d \u201cVictorious Leader,\u201d \u201cTriumphant Force,\u201d \u201cSuperior One,\u201d \u201cSuperior Banner,\u201d \u201cHeroic Subduer of Devilish Forces,\u201d and \u201cTen Power\u2013Wielding*1 Conqueror of Devilish Forces.\u201d*2\n\nIn other words, the Buddha is the leader who triumphs in the struggle against devilish functions. Victory attests to the power of Buddhism, the power of faith.\n\nReferring to his battle with devilish forces, Nichiren Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cThe devil king of the sixth heaven*3 has roused the ten kinds of troops and, in the midst of the sea of the sufferings of birth and death, is at war with the votary [practitioner] of the Lotus Sutra to stop him from taking possession of and to wrest away from him this impure land where both ordinary people and sages dwell.*4\n\n\u201cIt has been twenty or more years now since I found myself in that situation and began the great battle. Not once have I thought of retreat.\u201d (WND-2, 465)\n\nThe \u201cten kinds of troops\u201d refers to various kinds of earthly desires or deluded impulses. The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom*5 lists them as follows:\nGreed. (Becoming attached to the five desires*6 and neglecting one\u2019s Buddhist practice as a result.)\nDiscouragement. (Being depressed and listless.)\nHunger and thirst. (Being assailed by these desires.)\nCraving. (Decline resulting from desire or attachment. It includes attachments stemming from love or sexual desire, or addiction to substances such as alcohol or other forms of pleasure-seeking.)\nSleepiness. (This doesn\u2019t mean that we are supposed to give up sleep. It refers rather to a lazy and negligent attitude or way of life. It may also include not making any serious attempt to improve oneself and just getting by with the least possible effort.)\nFear. (Succumbing to one\u2019s anxieties and being cowardly.)\nDoubt and regret. (Devilish functions that try to lead practitioners astray and cause them to doubt or regret the path they are pursuing.)\nAnger. (Allowing angry thoughts to obstruct one\u2019s practice.)\nFame, fortune, and false glory. (Allowing attachment to material gain and worldly reputation lead one away from the path of attaining Buddhahood.)\nArrogance and contempt for others. (Thinking highly of oneself and scorning others.)\nThese, incidentally, are the arrogant tendencies exhibited by individuals who abandoned their faith and attacked the Soka Gakkai. In short, such individuals allowed themselves to be defeated by these ten armies of the devil king, captured by them, and enlisted in their ranks.\n\nWhat is the weapon for vanquishing these ten armies? It is none other than the \u201csharp sword\u201d of faith. That\u2019s why leaders of kosen-rufu need, first and foremost, to be courageous people of strong faith. Otherwise, no matter how excellent and accomplished they may seem, they will not be victorious in the battle against devilish functions at the fundamental level of life. Strong faith is the measure of a truly strong person.\n\nIn this passage, the Daishonin asserts that an intense battle is being fought between the Buddha and devilish forces throughout the universe, which Buddhism describes as the \u201csea of the sufferings of birth and death.\u201d\n\nThe entire universe is the stage of a colossal struggle\u2014a struggle between constructive and destructive forces, between the energy toward order and harmony and the turbulent currents leading to disorder and chaos, between the power of compassion that unites and the power of hate that sunders, between life and death, light and darkness, happiness and misery, advance and retreat, rise and fall, freedom and constraint, hope and despair, the energy to nurture life and the impulse to kill. Do we follow the Law that leads to happiness or become enslaved by the workings of the devil king that seek to darken the world with misfortune?\n\nIt is vital that we follow the Law that leads to eternal happiness and build a realm of indestructible and everlasting joy. This is our mission as practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nFrom a speech at a young men\u2019s division leaders meeting, Tokyo, June 26, 1990.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Ten powers: The powers of a Buddha. They are (1) the power of knowing what is true and what is not; (2) the power of knowing karmic causality at work in the lives of all beings throughout past, present, and future; (3) the power of knowing all stages of concentration, emancipation, and meditation; (4) the power of knowing the state of life of all people; (5) the power of judging all people\u2019s understanding; (6) the power of discerning the superiority or inferiority of all people\u2019s capacity; (7) the power of knowing the effects of all people\u2019s actions; (8) the power of remembering past lifetimes; (9) the power of knowing when each person will be born and die, and in what realm that person will be reborn; and (10) the power of eradicating all illusions.\n*2These names are found in the Great Majesty Dharani Sutra (Chin. Daweide tuoluoni jing; Jpn. Dai-itoku darani-kyo) and other sutras.\n*3Devil king of the sixth heaven: Also, devil king or heavenly devil. The king of devils, who dwells in the highest or the sixth heaven of the world of desire. He is also named Freely Enjoying Things Conjured by Others, the king who makes free use of the fruits of others\u2019 efforts for his own pleasure. Served by innumerable minions, he obstructs Buddhist practice and delights in sapping the life force of other beings, the manifestation of the fundamental darkness inherent in life. The devil king is a personification of the negative tendency to force others to one\u2019s will at any cost.\n*4\u201cThis impure land where both ordinary people and sages dwell\u201d refers to this saha world, where ordinary people of the six paths (the realms of hell, hungry spirits, animals, asuras, human beings, and heavenly beings) and sages of the four noble worlds (the realms of voice-hearers, cause-awakened ones, bodhisattvas, and Buddhas) dwell together. One of the four kinds of lands described in the doctrine of the T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai school of Buddhism.\n*5The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom: A comprehensive commentary on the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, traditionally attributed to Nagarjuna (c. 150\u2013250). Only the Chinese version translated by Kumarajiva exists today. The work explains the concepts of wisdom and of non-substantiality, and the bodhisattva ideal and the six paramitas, among others. It also incorporates concepts from the Lotus Sutra and other Mahayana sutras, and is considered an extremely important work of Mahayana thought in general.\n*6Five desires: The desires that arise from the contact of the five sense organs (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body) with their respective objects (color and form, sound, smell, taste, and texture).\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.1]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.3]"}, {"title": "chapter-16-3.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.3]\n16.3 Buddhism Originates from Shakyamuni\u2019s Triumph Over Inner Devilish Functions\nIn his novel The New Human Revolution, President Ikeda presents an interpretative imagining of Shakyamuni\u2019s life, based on biographical accounts described in various Buddhist writings and handed down in Buddhist tradition. This excerpt depicts Shakyamuni\u2019s enlightenment under the bodhi tree as a drama of winning over fundamental ignorance\u2014the working of inner devilish functions\u2014the ultimate struggle in Buddhism.\n\nShakyamuni continued his meditation under the bodhi tree.\n\nAccording to Buddhist writings, at this time demons began to tempt him. The devious means they resorted to differ depending on the source, but it is interesting to note that some involved tempting him with words of apparent kindness and concern.\n\nIn one account, for example, a demon tried to sway Shakyamuni by whispering to him gently: \u201cLook how gaunt you are, how pale your face is. You\u2019re surely on the verge of death. If you keep sitting here like this, it will be a miracle if you survive.\u201d\n\nAfter pointing out the peril he was in and strongly urging him to live, the demon tried to persuade Shakyamuni that if he instead followed the teachings of Brahmanism, he could accumulate great benefit without having to undergo such hardship. Shakyamuni\u2019s efforts to attain enlightenment, the demon declared, were meaningless.\n\nThe demon\u2019s appeals here can be seen as giving voice to the fierce struggle unfolding within Shakyamuni\u2019s mind at that moment.\n\nDoubt assailed him, shattering his inner peace and throwing his mind into turmoil. With his body extremely weak and his physical reserves all but depleted, the terror of death must have risen in his heart. Shakyamuni\u2019s mental torment was all the greater because, knowing that he had gained nothing from the intense austerities he had previously undertaken, he began to have doubts, thinking that perhaps this present effort to attain enlightenment, too, would prove to be in vain.\n\nHe was assaulted simultaneously by attachment to worldly desires, by physical hunger, by craving for sleep, also by fear and doubt.\n\nDemons or devils represent the workings of earthly desires and illusions attempting to unsettle the mind of those who seek the way to true enlightenment. Sometimes devils arise in the form of our attachments to worldly desires, or appear as such physical cravings as hunger or sleepiness. At other times, they torture the mind in the form of anxiety, fear, and doubt.\n\nWhenever people are led astray by such devilish functions, they invariably justify their failing in some way. Furthermore, they convince themselves that their justification is perfectly reasonable and natural.\n\nFor example, since in Shakyamuni\u2019s day no one had yet attained enlightenment, it may have seemed quite reasonable for him to question whether his meditation under the bodhi tree would achieve his goal.\n\nMore often than not, devilish functions cause people to clutch at some seemingly reasonable conclusion that vindicates their weaknesses and emotional needs. Nichiren Daishonin warns of this, citing the words: \u201cThe devil will watch over him like a parent\u201d*1 (WND-1, 770).\n\nHowever, Shakyamuni saw these devilish functions for what they were and summoned a powerful life force, sweeping away all the disruptive thoughts that plagued him. In his heart, he cried out: \u201cDemons! You may defeat a coward, but the brave will triumph. I will fight. I would rather die fighting than live in defeat!\u201d\n\nWith this, his mind was restored to a state of tranquility.\n\nThe quiet blanket of night enfolded him, as countless stars above glittered with a pure, crystalline brilliance.\n\nAfter triumphing over the onslaught of devilish forces, Shakyamuni\u2019s mind was left fresh and invigorated, his spirit as clear as a cloudless blue sky.\n*\nShakyamuni awakened to the eternal nature of life, to the Law underlying all existence throughout past, present, and future.\n\nAt that moment, all fears and doubts that had resided in the depths of his life like a heavy sediment since birth evaporated. He had arrived at last at the deep, immovable roots of his own existence.\n\nHe felt the darkness of illusion that shrouded him fall away as the brilliant light of wisdom illuminated his life. He had unlocked within himself a state of being akin to commanding a clear, unhindered view in all directions from atop a lofty mountain peak.\n*\nFor a time, Shakyamuni simply savored the joy of awakening to the Law\u2014the law of cause and effect governing all life and the universe\u2014but soon he began to grow deeply troubled. He faced a painful new dilemma: Should he preach this Law to others or should he remain silent? Sitting in the shade of the bodhi tree, he agonized for many days over this question.\n\nNo one had ever before heard, let alone expounded, this magnificent, unsurpassed Law. A vast gap lay between the brilliant realm within his own being and the real world outside.\n\nPeople lived in torment, fearing sickness, aging, and death. Consumed by desire, they fought constantly among themselves. All this was due to their ignorance of the Law of life. Yet even if he taught them the Law for their own sake, it was possible that no one would comprehend it.\n\nShakyamuni felt completely alone. His was the loneliness of the truly enlightened; something known only to those who have gained an understanding of a profound principle or truth that no one else is aware of.\n*\nOne account depicts demons reappearing at this point to torment Shakyamuni. This episode can again be interpreted as a struggle with the devilish functions in his own life, which were now attempting to dissuade him from teaching the Law to others.\n\nShakyamuni couldn\u2019t stem this upsurge of doubt and hesitation at the thought of forging ahead and spreading the Law. He agonized over what to do. Devilish functions thus continued to plague Shakyamuni even after he had become a Buddha. They vied to attack him through even the smallest breach in his heart.\n\nA Buddha is not a superhuman being. One who has attained this state continues to experience problems, suffering, and pain, and is still subject to illness and to temptation by devilish forces. For that reason, a Buddha is a person of courage, tenacity, and continuous action who struggles ceaselessly against devilish functions.\n\nNo matter how lofty a state we may achieve, without persistent efforts to advance and improve, our faith can be destroyed in a moment.\n\nAccording to a Buddhist text, the deity Brahma appeared before the still indecisive Shakyamuni and entreated him to preach the Law to all people. This episode symbolizes the powerful determination that welled up in Shakyamuni\u2019s life to go forward and fulfill his mission.\n\n\u201cI will go forth!\u201d he resolved with finality. \u201cThose who seek to learn will surely listen. Those of little impurity will understand. I shall go out among the people, who are shrouded in delusion and ignorance!\u201d\n\nOnce he had made this determination, he felt a surge of new energy flow through him. At this moment, a great lion stood up for the happiness of humanity.\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 3, \u201cThe Buddha\u201d chapter.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Miao-lo, The Annotations on \u201cGreat Concentration and Insight.\u201d\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.2]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.4]"}, {"title": "chapter-16-4.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.4]\n16.4 Winning Over Ourselves Today\nReferring to the principle of self-mastery, which the eminent British historian Arnold J. Toynbee stressed in their dialogue together, President Ikeda explains that individual victories over ourselves are the foundation for the human revolution that is the key to transforming society and, ultimately, the history of humankind.\n\nOne point that Professor Toynbee stressed in our dialogue Choose Life was the principle of self-mastery\u2014in other words, winning over ourselves. This entails transcending the lesser self that is dominated by egoism and bringing forth the greater self that is oriented to serving the welfare and happiness of others.\n\nIt was the keen observation of Professor Toynbee, one of the leading historians of the 20th century, that self-mastery is indispensable for resolving the crises confronting humanity. His conception of self-mastery is what we of the Soka Gakkai call human revolution.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe struggle to master one\u2019s self is the personal action of an individual human being.\u201d*1 The inner victory of each individual will lead to great positive development in society, and eventually even change the course of human history itself.\n\nWhat will be the key to winning on the new stage of the 21st century? It is, first of all, winning over ourselves today, changing ourselves for the better today. Let\u2019s deeply take this point to heart.\n\nFaith is the source of limitless strength. Religion is the earth from which culture flourishes. The Mystic Law is the wellspring of happiness. Our Buddhist practice gives us the strength to live, to grow, to win, and to surmount any kind of karma.\n\nNichiren Buddhism doesn\u2019t use people as a means to an end. It empowers them to stand up courageously, win over themselves, and share their joy with others. This is the correct way of Buddhist practice followed by the Soka Gakkai.\n\nScientific progress is important, as of course are business, politics, and education. But there is something more important still, and that is life itself. Inner transformation is the foundation for everything. Both Shakyamuni and Nichiren Daishonin taught this.\n\nThe Daishonin revealed the fundamental law that pervades life and universe. He left a way for all people to live with compassion and enjoy happiness and peace.\n\nThe supreme law of life and the universe is the Mystic Law, and all of you who uphold it are treasures of the world.\n\nThe law of cause and effect in Buddhism is unerring. Please be reassured, therefore, that all who dedicate themselves to the Mystic Law will, in lifetime after lifetime, be outstanding leaders endowed with health, wealth, and attractiveness, who contribute to society, are praised and admired by all, and lead lives of deep fulfillment.\n\nFrom a speech at a Hong Kong and Macao executive leaders conference, Hong Kong, December 4, 2000.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Arnold Toynbee and Daisaku Ikeda, Choose Life: A Dialogue, edited by Richard L.

Professor Toynbee explains this by citing a passage from Goethe\u2019s drama Faust. Faust declares to Mephistopheles, the devil personified, who represents the obstacle he must challenge: \u201cIf on a bed of sloth I ever lie contented, / may I be done for then and there!\u201d*1\n\nThe moment we assume the attitude: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to continue making effort. I can just take it easy and relax. I don\u2019t need to expand my activities or challenge myself any further\u201d\u2014from that instant, our downhill decline begins. This, Professor Toynbee argues, is an unchanging rule of history.\n\nThis rule holds true for individuals and for organizations as well. No matter how great the problems or obstacles that beset us, by challenging them and turning them to our advantage, we can become stronger and develop further.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cDoesn\u2019t a fire burn more briskly when logs are added? . . . Were it not for the flowing rivers, there would be no sea\u201d (WND-1, 33).*2\n\nJust like these examples, practitioners of the Mystic Law grow stronger and more resilient with each obstacle they encounter. Those who advance with such powerful energy and life force are history\u2019s victors, are winners in life. The important thing is for us to become strong and to make our organization strong.\n\nThe Daishonin cites the words: \u201cThe stronger one\u2019s faith, the greater the protection of the [Buddhist] gods\u201d*3 (WND-1, 614). It is an admonition, in one respect, to not depend on others.\n\nThis passage attests that we should abandon the indulgent tendency to assume that someone will naturally come to our aid or take our side. It conveys the message that we ourselves need to become stronger, for only then can we activate the protective functions of the universe and win in life.\n\nFrom a message to a Yamanashi Prefecture women\u2019s division leaders meeting, September 30, 1997.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Faust I & II, edited and translated by Stuart Atkins, in Goethe\u2019s Collected Works, vol. 2 (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1994), p. 44.\n*2The full quote reads: \u201cDoesn\u2019t a fire burn more briskly when logs are added? All rivers flow into the sea, but does the sea turn back their waters? The currents of hardship pour into the sea of the Lotus Sutra and rush against its votary. The river is not rejected by the ocean; nor does the votary reject suffering. Were it not for the flowing rivers, there would be no sea. Likewise, without tribulation there would be no votary of the Lotus Sutra\u201d (WND-1, 33; \u201cA Ship to Cross the Sea of Suffering\u201d).\n*3Miao-lo, The Annotations on \u201cGreat Concentration and Insight.\u201d\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.4]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.6]"}, {"title": "chapter-16-6.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.6]\n16.6 Stand Up with Faith Based on a Vow\nThis excerpt from The New Human Revolution depicts an exchange during a discussion meeting with the novel\u2019s protagonist, Shin\u2019ichi Yamamoto (whose character represents President Ikeda), on his first visit to Brazil in October 1960. Here, he warmly encourages a Japanese migrant struggling to make a living as a farmer.\n\nA man in his early 40s introduced himself stiffly, with the formality of a soldier standing at attention, announcing: \u201cI\u2019m a farmer!\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, relax,\u201d said Shin\u2019ichi. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the army. We\u2019re all friends, all a family. Just relax as you would at home.\u201d\n\nThe members present laughed. A bright smile lit the man\u2019s sunburnt face.\n\nHe then explained that he had recently started farming vegetables, but his crop had failed, leaving him heavily in debt. He wanted to know what he could do to overcome the situation.\n\n\u201cWhat was the reason for your crop failure?\u201d Shin\u2019ichi asked.\n\n\u201cI think it might have been partly due to the weather,\u201d the man replied.\n\n\u201cAre there other farmers growing the same vegetables as you who produced a successful crop?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but most people\u2019s crops failed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas there some problem with the fertilizer you used?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really sure . . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cWas there a problem with the way you tended your crop?\u201d\n\nSilence.\n\n\u201cWhat about the suitability of the soil for the kind of vegetables you were trying to grow?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know . . . .\u201d\n\nThe man couldn\u2019t reply satisfactorily to any of Shin\u2019ichi\u2019s questions.\n\nAs a farmer, he was clearly working hard and trying to do the best he could. But so was everyone else. He was unaware of his own complacence in thinking that what he had been doing was enough.\n\nShin\u2019ichi began to speak in a penetrating tone: \u201cFirst, it is vital that you thoroughly investigate the cause that led to your crop failure so that you don\u2019t make the same mistake again. You might want to talk with farmers who have been successful and take note of what they have to say.\n\n\u201cIt is also important that you take sufficient measures to prevent failure. People who are deadly serious about what they are doing are always studying and exerting their ingenuity to solve problems. You won\u2019t be successful if you neglect such things.\n\n\u201cYou are greatly mistaken if you think that just because you practice this Buddhism your fields will yield abundant crops without any effort on your part. Buddhism is a teaching of unsurpassed reason. Therefore, the strength of your faith must manifest itself in the form of studying, exercising your ingenuity, and exerting twice as much effort as anyone else.\n\n\u201cEarnestly chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the wellspring for the energy to rise to that challenge. And your chanting must also be based on a vow.\u201d\n\n\u201cA vow?\u201d asked the man, puzzled.\n\n\u201cBy a vow,\u201d Shin\u2019ichi continued, \u201cI mean making a personal pledge and praying to fulfill it. Some people just pray that everything they want will fall into their laps without effort on their own part. But a religion that encourages that kind of prayer disempowers people. Prayer in Nichiren Buddhism means chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo based on a vow. The essence of this vow is the realization of kosen-rufu.\n\n\u201cIn other words, it means chanting resolutely with the determination, \u2018I will realize kosen-rufu in Brazil. To achieve that, I will show magnificent actual proof of the benefit of Nichiren Buddhism in my work. Please enable me to give play to my fullest potential.\u2019 This is what our prayer should be like.\n\n\u201cIt is also important that we establish clear and concrete goals for what we hope to achieve each day and then pray and challenge ourselves to achieve each of them. This earnest determination gives rise to wisdom and resourcefulness, thereby leading to success. In short, to win in life we need determination and prayer, effort and ingenuity. It is misguided to dream of getting rich quick, expecting to encounter a rare stroke of luck or some shrewd money-making scheme. That is not faith. It is mere fantasy.\n\n\u201cOur work is the mainstay that supports our lives. Unless we show real evidence of victory in our work, we cannot demonstrate the principle that faith equals daily life. Please rid yourself of any laxness and reapply yourself wholeheartedly to your work with a fresh determination.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do my best!\u201d said the man, his eyes filled with resolve.\n\nShin\u2019ichi was well aware of the hardships many of these members striving as migrant farmers were facing. To be successful under such circumstances, they would above all have to battle their own complacency. The enemy they had to face was within.\n\nThe greater the adversity, the more important it is to resolve that it is a decisive moment in your life and to keep challenging yourself. It is here that the beneficial power of the Gohonzon becomes apparent. Adversity is therefore an opportunity to prove the power of Buddhism.\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 1, \u201cPioneers\u201d chapter.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.5]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.7]"}, {"title": "chapter-16-7.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.7]\n16.7 Winning Means Refusing to Be Defeated\nPresident Ikeda calls on young women\u2019s division members to live their lives with an invincible spirit.\n\n\u201cNever be defeated!\nHappiness resides\nin strong hearts.\u201d\n\nFaith equals daily life, and Buddhism is manifested in society. It is inconceivable, therefore, that our Buddhist practice and the teachings of Buddhism would fail to help us win in our daily lives and society or become happy.\n\nFaith, practice, and study are the key. As we put into action the teachings of Nichiren Daishonin, the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law, let us patiently continue climbing the mountain of victory and happiness day after day, our hearts brimming with hope and optimism. Our life\u2019s purpose is to live, strive, and win not only for our own happiness, but also for the happiness of others and the noble cause of good.\n\nWe all experience problems, sadness, and suffering. But sufferings arising from earthly desires are the springboard to enlightenment. The more we suffer, the more our life state expands. This is the essential principle of the Mystic Law.\n\nThough we may, for example, be facing a situation as painful as the fires of hell, we can transform it without fail into the happiness of the Land of Tranquil Light.*1\n\nThe absence of problems and suffering is not happiness. Refusing to be defeated, being able to endure whatever comes our way\u2014that is happiness.\n\nEven if we\u2019re facing many pressures, prompting people in our lives to comment on how hard our circumstances are, we need to just calmly and steadily press ahead on the path of our mission. That\u2019s the way to make the powerful life force of the Buddha\u2014who is also known as \u201cOne Who Can Endure\u201d\u2014well up in our lives.\n\nThose who experience the greatest suffering will come to attain the greatest happiness. Never forget that happiness is a flower that blossoms from the earth of patient endurance.\n\nOne of the youthful mottoes of my wife, Kaneko, a member of the first class of the young women\u2019s division, was:\n\n\u201cToday again don\u2019t be defeated,\ntoday again bring forth courage,\nas you make your way\non the path of your vow,\non the path of victory.\u201d\n\nThose who don\u2019t let anything defeat them are victors. In particular, those who lead undefeated lives, following through on the beliefs that they vowed to uphold in their youth, are the strongest and most admirable of all.\n\nPeople who can make others happy know genuine happiness.\n\nTrue victory is becoming a sunlike presence that brightens the lives of everyone around you. In such a person\u2019s heart will fly a banner of happiness proudly emblazoned with a spirit of self-reliance and self-esteem.\n\nNo banner of victory adorns a life of inaction. No banner of happiness will fly where faith is not accompanied by action.\n\nIn this noble and meaningful period of your youth and on throughout your lives, please overcome every obstacle without being defeated, forging ahead on your chosen path with the brilliant light of victory shining in your hearts like the morning sun. That is the most truly human way to live. This is the spirit of Nichiren Buddhism. This is the essence of our Buddhist practice.\n\n\u201cDifficulties will arise, and these are to be looked on as [peace and comfort]\u201d (cf. OTT, 115)\u2014let us always remember these profound words of the Daishonin.\n\nFrom an essay series \u201cThe Light of the Century of Humanity,\u201d published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, November 13, 2004.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Land of Tranquil Light: Also, Land of Eternally Tranquil Light. The Buddha land, which is free from impermanence and impurity. In many sutras, the actual saha world in which human beings dwell is described as an impure land filled with delusions and sufferings, while the Buddha land is described as a pure land free from these and far removed from this saha world. In contrast, the Lotus Sutra reveals the saha world to be the Buddha land, or the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light, and explains that the nature of a land is determined by the minds of its inhabitants.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.6]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.8]"}, {"title": "chapter-16-8.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.8]\n16.8 \u201cWhere There Is Unseen Virtue, There Will Be Visible Reward\u201d\nPresident Ikeda stresses the importance of accumulating \u201cunseen virtue,\u201d observing that the tireless, often unnoticed, efforts of members striving for kosen-rufu together in the unity of \u201cmany in body, one in mind\u201d have been the driving force of the Soka Gakkai\u2019s remarkable development.\n\nWhy has the Soka Gakkai achieved such phenomenal development despite encountering persecution and attack time and time again? In short, it is because our members, united in the spirit of \u201cmany in body, one in mind,\u201d have been carrying out activities of immense \u201cunseen virtue.\u201d\n\nOur membership comprises people from all different backgrounds, professions, and social positions. In that sense, we are \u201cmany in body.\u201d At the same time, all of us are striving together to realize kosen-rufu, move the world in the direction of peace, and achieve happiness for ourselves and others. We are therefore \u201cone in mind.\u201d The Soka Gakkai has been forging ahead based on this unity of \u201cmany in body, one in mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnseen virtue,\u201d as the term implies, means good deeds that go unnoticed or unrecognized by others. Our daily Soka Gakkai activities are not glamorous. We engage in one-to-one dialogue, gather in small groups to study and support one another, and hold and attend discussion meetings. There\u2019s no spotlight, and our activities are not going to land us in the papers or on television. On the contrary, people may criticize us due to their misunderstanding or malign us out of jealousy. Nevertheless, whether praised or not, we continue to devote ourselves purposefully to our goal of kosen-rufu, steadfastly engaging in acts of unseen virtue. That is why the Soka Gakkai has been victorious.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cWhere there is unseen virtue, there will be visible reward\u201d (WND-1, 907) and \u201cUnseen virtue brings about visible reward\u201d (WND-1, 940). He assures us that those who perform unseen good deeds will enjoy clear, positive results without fail. In fact, those who unceasingly carry out such actions have already won. There is absolutely no doubt that they will reap wonderful rewards, as will their families and descendants. This is how we should strive to live our lives.\n\nTo seek to put up a good image to impress others, amass a quick fortune, or become an overnight success\u2014without making any effort to develop yourself as a person or to contribute to others\u2019 happiness\u2014is nothing but empty, self-serving vanity. It is merely chasing phantoms. People with such shallow hearts cannot savor true happiness.\n\nThe Daishonin addressed the passages on unseen virtue bringing visible reward I just cited to his loyal disciple Shijo Kingo.\n\nWhen the mentor, Nichiren Daishonin, suffered relentless persecution like that described in the Lotus Sutra, many of his disciples were shaken with doubt. \u201cWe started to practice this faith to become happy, so why are we always being persecuted? Why do we have to suffer like this?\u201d Such misgivings whirled inside them. Some disciples even rebuked their mentor, laying all the blame for their troubles on him. People lost faith because of cowardice. Many deserted him. Others still, forgetting their debt of gratitude, betrayed and attacked him.\n\nAt such a time, it was Shijo Kingo and his wife, Nichigen-nyo, who staunchly supported and protected the Daishonin. That is why so many of his writings are addressed to them. Shijo Kingo also accompanied the Daishonin during the Tatsunokuchi Persecution,*1 ready to die at his side. He is a model disciple and an inspiration to us all. Shijo Kingo even hastened to visit the Daishonin in exile on Sado Island. Unlike today, with the conveniences of modern transport, traveling to Sado meant an arduous and perilous journey. It is probably difficult for us to imagine just how hard it was.\n\nShijo Kingo himself also became the target of persecution by jealous fellow samurai and the scheming priest Ryokan, who hated the Daishonin. These parties spread false rumors in an attempt to discredit him. [Shijo Kingo\u2019s lord, Ema, was a devoted follower of Ryokan.] Not only did he face the threat of having his lands confiscated and being banished to another province, but attempts were also made on his life. Undeterred, Shijo Kingo fought his way bravely through all these bitter trials, \u201cemploying the strategy of the Lotus Sutra,\u201d just as the Daishonin taught (cf. WND-1, 1001).\n\nWorking alongside my mentor, Mr. Toda, I also struggled against the three powerful enemies*2 and the three obstacles and four devils.*3 And particularly during the most difficult period when his business fell into dire straits, I went through indescribable hardships to support him. I alone stood by his side through everything. Looking back, that was the happiest time of my life. It is because of all those tremendous unseen efforts I made at that time that today\u2019s Soka Gakkai exists.\n\nShijo Kingo, who exerted himself in faith in accord with the Daishonin\u2019s instructions, won in the end. He gained trust both from his lord and in society at large, and he eventually received landholdings three times larger than those he had before. The Daishonin rejoiced with all his heart at his disciple\u2019s victory, saying: \u201cAs I have often mentioned before, it is said that, where there is unseen virtue, there will be visible reward\u201d (WND-1, 907). He also exclaims to the effect: \u201cYou encountered terrible persecution as a result of spreading the correct teaching of Buddhism, but, now, how fortunate your circumstances have become!\u201d (cf. WND-1, 940).\n\nIt is the principle that those who uphold the correct teaching will always prevail. No matter how much hardship we may undergo for the sake of Buddhism, as long as we persevere with courageous faith, we will definitely be able to surmount everything. What is more, we will attain a vast state of life, beyond anything we could imagine. Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s words are true in every respect.\n\nSome people seek nothing but visible reward, such as fame, popularity, or material wealth. But these things are all fleeting. We can accumulate eternal, indestructible good fortune only through acts of unseen virtue. I can say this unequivocally, based on reason and experience.\n\n\u201cUnseen virtue brings about visible reward\u201d means that those who work hardest behind the scenes enjoy the greatest reward. It is a strict, impartial, hope-inspiring principle. This is the teaching of Buddhism, and it is why participating in Soka Gakkai activities is so important.\n\nAlthough activities for kosen-rufu may involve a lot of hard work, all of you are walking this great path of life exactly as the Daishonin teaches. Life is eternal. I hope you will be confident that the good fortune and benefit you accumulate by exerting yourselves in Soka Gakkai activities will also flow to your families and loved ones.\n\nFrom a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Tokyo, April 22, 2004.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Tatsunokuchi Persecution: The failed attempt, instigated by powerful government figures, to behead the Daishonin under the cover of darkness on the beach at Tatsunokuchi, on the outskirts of Kamakura, on September 12, 1271.\n*2Three powerful enemies: Three types of arrogant people who persecute those who propagate the Lotus Sutra in the evil age after Shakyamuni Buddha\u2019s death, described in the concluding verse section of the \u201cEncouraging Devotion\u201d (13th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra.

All phenomena in the universe, all things without exception, are constantly and endlessly changing. There are all too many examples of people who have risen to the heights of fame and glory only to plummet to abysmal depths at the end of their days.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cAt times we are born as human beings, becoming rulers of various countries, high ministers, court nobles, or other court officials, and we think ourselves incomparably happy. Thus we content ourselves with such little gains and are delighted with them.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Buddha has taught that these accomplishments are mere prosperity in a dream, a phantom joy, and that we should simply accept and uphold the Lotus Sutra and quickly become Buddhas.\u201d (WND-2, 36)\n\nFrom the perspective of Buddhism, however puffed up with self-importance people of power, government officials, politicians, or celebrities may be, their status and position amount to nothing but \u201cprosperity in a dream\u201d or \u201ca phantom joy\u201d\u2014fleeting illusions of happiness.\n\nIt is a waste to spend one\u2019s brief time on earth chasing after illusions, living in pursuit of ephemeral glories or racked by jealousy for those who seem to have attained them.\n\nWhat, then, is the noblest and most meaningful way to live? The Daishonin indicates that striving to attain Buddhahood is the path to eternal happiness and is itself an unsurpassed way of life. In other words, the answer is to make our lives shine their brightest as entities of the Mystic Law.\n\nThough their lives may not be exciting or glamorous, true victors, genuine champions, are those who strive seriously in their Buddhist practice, exert themselves earnestly for kosen-rufu, and live always together with the imperishable Mystic Law.\n\nKosen-rufu is a great eternal endeavor. Those who devote themselves to this path will savor boundless happiness and joy throughout eternity, the Daishonin asserts. This is his promise. I therefore wish to declare again that members of the Soka Gakkai are the world\u2019s foremost heroes, people of unsurpassed humanity.\n\nIn a famous passage, Nichiren Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cIt is rare to be born a human being. The number of those endowed with human life is as small as the amount of earth one can place on a fingernail. Life as a human being is hard to sustain\u2014as hard as it is for the dew to remain on the grass. But it is better to live a single day with honor than to live to 120 and die in disgrace.\u201d (WND-1, 851)\n\nA long life is not necessarily a good life. What matters is what we leave behind, what kind of value we create, and how many people we help become happy.\n\nUltimately, therefore, dedicating ourselves to kosen-rufu is the supreme way to live. It is the greatest possible contribution we can make to society. It brings happiness to ourselves and other people. Buddhism and society, faith and daily life\u2014both are inseparable.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Daishonin urges us to work for the sake of the Lotus Sutra and kosen-rufu and to make a reputation for ourselves through such efforts. He calls on us to create and leave behind a proud record of personal achievement, free of regrets, knowing that we have done our very best in the limited time available to us in this life.\n\nIf we are going to challenge something, we may as well do it with a bright and positive attitude. It\u2019s no fun otherwise. When we make efforts on our own initiative and challenge our goals cheerfully, we will be filled with joy and an upsurge of energy.\n\nLet\u2019s challenge ourselves joyfully. Those who advance with joy accumulate good fortune. Buddhism is about winning; it is an ongoing struggle. Those who strive joyfully will win in the end. Those who base themselves on faith in the Mystic Law and on chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo are sure to be ultimate victors.\n\nFrom a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Tokyo, March 24, 1993.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.8]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.10]"}, {"title": "chapter-16-10.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.10]\n16.10 Leading a Winning Life Based on the Mystic Law\nPresident Ikeda explains that those who base themselves on the Mystic Law can create positive value from their successes as well as their setbacks and failures, all of which will help them surmount the next challenge that awaits and savor ultimate victory in life.\n\nThe fundamental aim of Nichiren Buddhism is the development of kosen-rufu. Time and time again in his writings, Nichiren Daishonin stresses the importance of kosen-rufu, or \u201cwidespread propagation\u201d of the Mystic Law. As such, the true measure of the success of our movement is the degree to which we have actually been able to expand the realm of kosen-rufu. Our ultimate goal is to build a peaceful and happy society based on Buddhist humanism and the philosophy of respect for the dignity of life. In that regard, even just continuing to advance a step or two at a time is fine.\n\nOf course, life is a succession of struggles, and we experience victories and defeats on various levels along the way. No matter how strong or capable we are, we can\u2019t always win. That\u2019s the way it is in life\u2019s struggles.\n\nMy mentor, Josei Toda, composed the following poem as one of his final messages to us:\n\n\u201cWinning and losing\nare both\npart of life,\nbut I pray to the Buddha\nfor final victory.\u201d\n\nLife is long, and there may be times when things don\u2019t work out as we hope. But we embrace the Mystic Law, the incomparable strategy of the Lotus Sutra (cf. WND-1, 1001). If we uphold the Lotus Sutra and base ourselves on faith throughout our lives, then no matter what successes or setbacks we may experience along the way, we are certain to win in the end. That is the great teaching of Buddhism. Therefore, we have nothing to worry about.\n\nWin or lose, the most important thing is whether we can make that particular result a cause for future victory. Every moment is a fresh start.\n\nLet\u2019s continue advancing together with optimism and confidence toward our next triumph, united solidly in purpose with our fellow members. This epitomizes the practice of the Buddhism of true cause\u2014a teaching of moving ever forward from the present moment.\n\nFrom a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Tokyo, September 14, 2005.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.9]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.11]"}, {"title": "chapter-16-11.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.11]\n16.11 \u201cSummon Up the Courage of a Lion King\u201d\nIn \u201cOn Persecutions Befalling the Sage,\u201d Nichiren Daishonin declares: \u201cEach of you should summon up the courage of a lion king and never succumb to threats from anyone\u201d (WND-1, 997). Based on this famous passage, President Ikeda discusses the essence of practicing Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nNichiren Daishonin urges his disciples: \u201cEach of you should summon up the courage of a lion king\u201d (WND-1, 997).\n\nThis is the essence of Nichiren Buddhism. As the passage indicates when it says \u201ceach of you,\u201d we each possess within the courage of a lion king. The basis for summoning forth that courage is faith grounded in a spirit of oneness with our mentor.\n\nThe courage of a lion king is the spirit of the mentor who has fearlessly opened the way for kosen-rufu. When we share that spirit as our own, we cannot fail to bring forth the courage of a lion king in our lives.\n\nWhen I was working my hardest to support Mr. Toda, I made a deep determination. To protect my mentor, a lion king, I resolved as his disciple to summon up the courage of a lion king and overcome every obstacle.\n\nWhen we strive with the same spirit as our mentor, we will never be deadlocked. Asking ourselves what our mentor would do, mustering all our wisdom and strength to respond to our mentor\u2019s hopes\u2014that spirit awakens the state of a lion king within us. It gives rise to the courage to triumph over every difficulty and challenge.\n\nMr. Toda often said that those who continue to strive courageously for kosen-rufu, the wish of Nichiren Daishonin, are bodhisattvas and Buddhas.\n\nThe spirit of a lion king is one of unwavering commitment. It is an invincible spirit, the Soka Gakkai spirit. It is by struggling with and winning over difficulties that we attain Buddhahood. That\u2019s why we have to summon the courage of a lion king. Faith is another name for the courage to always move forward.\n\nFrom the early days of the Soka Gakkai, our members fought on tirelessly, refusing to allow unfounded criticism and abuse to defeat them. They did so in accord with the Daishonin\u2019s admonition to \u201cnever succumb to threats from anyone\u201d (WND-1, 997). They gritted their teeth and did not retreat a single step. Those who advance, even if just a step, or just a millimeter, are victors. Not giving in to defeat is the way to accumulate imperishable treasures of the heart and, in so doing, to accomplish one\u2019s human revolution and transform one\u2019s karma. In the realm of faith, those who sincerely persevere in their Buddhist practice are certain to be crowned with brilliant victory in the end.\n\nContinuing, the Daishonin writes: \u201cThe lion king fears no other beast, nor do its cubs. Slanderers are like barking foxes, but Nichiren\u2019s followers are like roaring lions\u201d (WND-1, 997). His writings contain numerous references to the lion king. He compares his enlightened state of life to that of a lion king to make it more easily understandable to his disciples. The Buddhist scriptures employ the lion king as a symbol for the Buddha.\n\nThe Daishonin also likens the Lotus Sutra, the king of sutras, to a lion king. Those who embrace this sutra will attain the life state of a lion king, fearless and confident, as he indicates with his assurance that one \u201cwill move about without fear like the lion king\u201d (WND-1, 412). Hence, he writes, when we chant the lion\u2019s roar of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, \u201cWhat sickness can therefore be an obstacle?\u201d (WND-1, 412).\n\nIn \u201cOn Persecutions Befalling the Sage,\u201d the Daishonin stresses that, just like the lion king, its cubs must not fear any other beasts (cf. WND-1, 997). It is the \u201cbarking foxes\u201d that run away in fear when they hear the lion\u2019s roar.\n\nThe key to battling obstacles or negative forces exists within our own hearts. Thus, no matter how formidable an obstacle or devilish function may be, there is no reason to fear it. Instead, what we should fear is giving in to the tendency in our hearts to let it sway or intimidate us (cf. WND-1, 501).*1\n\nThe key to victory is to remain undefeated in spirit. \u201cIt is the heart that is important\u201d (WND-1, 1000). Victors in spirit are victors in life.\n\nIn this passage, the Daishonin refers to \u201cNichiren\u2019s followers\u201d (WND-1, 997). In the 27 years since establishing his teaching [in 1253], he had fought against and triumphed over all kinds of powerful enemies and harsh persecutions. \u201cNichiren\u2019s followers\u201d implies those who have forged a profound mentor-disciple bond with him.\n\nI read his use of \u201cNichiren\u2019s followers\u201d as powerful encouragement that proclaims: \u201cYou are all my disciples! As such, if you strive in the same way I have, you will definitely win!\u201d\n\nDisciples who embrace the great aim of kosen-rufu and follow the example of a great teacher full of compassion, courage, and wisdom will never be defeated. The lion king is always victorious. The lion cubs must resolve to become lion kings, too. Now is the time for them to do so. The Daishonin\u2019s disciples should all encourage one another that the time to stand up resolutely as lion kings has arrived.\n\nFrom a lecture series \u201cBuddhism of the Sun: Illuminating the World,\u201d published in Japanese in the Daibyakurenge, November 2015.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1In \u201cLetter to the Brothers,\u201d the Daishonin cites a passage from T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai\u2019s Great Concentration and Insight that states: \u201cAs practice progresses and understanding grows, the three obstacles and four devils emerge in confusing form, vying with one another to interfere. . . . One should neither be influenced nor frightened by them. If one falls under their influence one will be led into the paths of evil. If one is frightened by them, one will be prevented from practicing the correct teaching\u201d (WND-1, 501).\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.10]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 17: Making the Most of Each Day [17.1]"}, {"title": "chapter-17-1.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 17: Making the Most of Each Day [17.1]\n17.1 Leading Fulfilling Lives, Free of Regret\nPresident Ikeda asserts: \u201cThe only way to lead a life free of regret is to make the most of each day. Today will never come again, so each day must be treasured, lived mindfully, with complete commitment. Each meeting may be my last encounter with that person. That\u2019s why I\u2019m determined to give my all to encouraging the person right in front of me and to treasure each individual to the utmost.\u201d\n\nTo live each day bravely and with all one\u2019s might\u2014this honest, persevering way of life is the essence of our practice of human revolution.\n\nThis chapter features selections from President Ikeda\u2019s guidance for making the most of each day, outlining from various perspectives, how to live our lives as practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nWhile strolling together with a group of young women\u2019s division representatives this morning, I discussed the subject of the best way to live.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cThe purpose of the appearance in this world of Shakyamuni Buddha, the lord of teachings, lies in his behavior as a human being\u201d (WND-1, 852).\n\n\u201cOur behavior as a human being\u201d\u2014what kind of behavior leads to a life of happiness and wisdom?\n\nThe Daishonin also teaches: \u201cYou must not spend your lives in vain and regret it for ten thousand years to come\u201d (WND-1, 622).\n\nHe is saying that we must not waste this precious existence, that we must not live in such a way that we are left with eternal regret.\n\nIt is, therefore, important that we choose a life of lasting fulfillment over one of shallow self-indulgence.\n\nNo matter how fun-filled or entertaining your life may seem, without a sense of fulfillment, it cannot truly be called happy. A life without any real purpose, which only leaves you feeling empty, is an unhappy one.\n\nIt\u2019s also important that we choose self-improvement over pleasure. Those committed to self-improvement have depth. They are attractive. They have hope.\n\nLikewise, we need to choose serious effort over resignation, to dare rather than retreat. Those who do so brim with energy and vitality.\n\nActing with compassion instead of arrogance, with courage rather than fear\u2014in such behavior lies the essence of Buddhism.\n\nIn the same spirit, I call on you to choose progress over stagnation, unity over disharmony, joy over pessimism, action over indecision, optimism over despondency.\n\nThe Soka Gakkai is a gathering of champions dedicated to spreading the correct teaching of Buddhism. To stand up proudly for truth and justice, rather than cast our lot with those who propound false and misguided ideas, is the path taught by Nichiren Daishonin.\n\nLet us always press forward steadily, come what may, choosing cheerfulness over gloom, encouragement over envy, enthusiasm over anger.\n\nLet us live out our lives with unwavering confidence, demonstrating a spirit of tolerance, not authoritarianism, filled with hope instead of despair, taking action instead of complaining, and engaging in dialogue, not violence.\n\nThose who fight against their own weaknesses and keep pressing forward resolutely\u2014challenging themselves instead of giving up, and taking personal responsibility for victory instead of criticizing others\u2014triumph in the end and attain happiness.\n\nMoreover, the efforts we make now determine not just this existence but our past, present, and future.\n\nFrom a speech at a Kansai Region representatives conference, Osaka, May 18, 1992.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 16: Buddhism Is about Winning [16.11]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 17: Making the Most of Each Day [17.2]"}, {"title": "chapter-17-2.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 17: Making the Most of Each Day [17.2]\n17.2 Examining the Causes and Effects That Exist in Our Lives in the Present\nPresident Ikeda says that when we elevate our present state of life, past negative causes are transformed into positive causes. He says that we should not be held back by the past; that we can, in fact, transform even the past. Our efforts in human revolution always begin with challenging ourselves from this moment on.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cThere can be no discontinuity between the three existences of past, present, and future\u201d (WND-1, 386). The past, present, and future are not separate from one another, but continuous and connected through the law of cause and effect.\n\nIn \u201cThe Opening of the Eyes,\u201d Nichiren Daishonin cites a sutra passage that states: \u201cIf you want to understand the causes that existed in the past, look at the results as they are manifested in the present. And if you want to understand what results will be manifested in the future, look at the causes that exist in the present\u201d (WND-1, 279).\n\nBuddhism teaches that our life now, at this present moment, contains all causes from the past and all the results or effects that will manifest in the future. This simultaneity of cause and effect means that eternity is encapsulated in the present moment. The teaching of the Mystic Law, the reality of three thousand realms in a single moment of life,*1 clearly elucidates this wondrous law of life and the universe.\n\nThe Buddha is called the \u201cThus Come One,\u201d a term referring to the dynamic activity of life pulsing with wisdom at each moment.\n\nThat\u2019s why the present moment is what matters, not some time in the future. We need to strive earnestly in faith, deepening our commitment to our Buddhist practice and transforming our karma, right here and now. This is the way to accumulate the causes for happiness, which also contain the effect or result of happiness.\n\nPlease be absolutely assured that you have made wondrous causes in the past to be able to work together for worldwide kosen-rufu at this time, and are certain to enjoy marvelous future benefit as a result of your present efforts.\n\nFrom a speech at an SGI general meeting, Tokyo, November 14, 1992.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Three thousand realms in a single moment of life: A philosophical system established by the Great Teacher T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai of China based on the Lotus Sutra.

Each of these worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself, thus making one hundred possible worlds. Each of these hundred worlds possesses the ten factors and operates within each of the three realms of existence, thus making three thousand realms. In other words, all phenomena are contained within a single moment of life, and a single moment of life permeates the three thousand realms of existence, or the entire phenomenal world.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 17: Making the Most of Each Day [17.1]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 17: Making the Most of Each Day [17.3]"}, {"title": "chapter-17-3.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 17: Making the Most of Each Day [17.3]\n17.3 \u201cNow Is the Last Moment of One\u2019s Life\u201d\nIn \u201cThe Heritage of the Ultimate Law of Life,\u201d Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cFor one who summons up one\u2019s faith and chants Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with the profound insight that now is the last moment of one\u2019s life, the sutra [Lotus Sutra] proclaims: \u2018When the lives of these persons come to an end, they will be received into the hands of a thousand Buddhas, who will free them from all fear and keep them from falling into the evil paths of existence\u2019 [LSOC28, 363]\u201d (WND-1, 216). Based on this passage, President Ikeda discusses the ultimate spirit of faith.\n\n\u201cWith the profound insight that now is the last moment of one\u2019s life\u201d (WND-1, 216) doesn\u2019t simply mean being ready or resolved. \u201cWith profound insight\u201d means recognizing and fully comprehending that this is the real nature of life.\n\nWe all think that we have plenty of time left in our lives. But none of us knows when death may overtake us. We may die in the next instant. That is the true reality of life.\n\nEven if we were to be guaranteed another 20, 30, or even 50 years of life, such time spans are, in the context of eternity, no more than fleeting moments. This is another sense of the insight that \u201cnow is the last moment of one\u2019s life\u201d (WND-1, 216).\n\nAny thoughtful person, having understood this, cannot help feeling the profound significance of being alive now and practicing Nichiren Buddhism. Such things as worldly power, fame, and riches are irrelevant. To accumulate good fortune that will not perish with death and for the sake of the eternal future, we cannot but focus on the true purpose of life while exerting ourselves wholeheartedly in our Buddhist practice.\n\nThis is the ultimate spirit of faith. Even so, as Buddhists and as members of human society, we are not meant to literally renounce or sacrifice everything of this world. Rather, when we exert ourselves earnestly in faith and practice with the great objective of kosen-rufu, everything in our lives is put to good use based on the Mystic Law. That is the essence of our commitment to live with the awareness that \u201cnow is the last moment of one\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nWhen we live each moment of our life with this commitment, we \u201cwill be received into the hands of a thousand Buddhas, who will free [us] from all fear and keep [us] from falling into the evil paths of existence\u201d (LSOC28, 363). That means that we attain a state of complete security and never fall into the evil paths of existence\u2014namely, the worlds of hell, hungry spirits, animals, and asuras.*1\n\nOn a superficial level, the passage \u201cWhen the lives of these persons come to an end, they will be received into the hands of a thousand Buddhas\u201d (LSOC28, 363) seems to suggest that this takes place at the moment of death, but on a more profound level, \u201ccome to an end\u201d refers to each successive moment in life. In that sense, it is describing a state that we can actually attain while still alive.\n\nThe phrase \u201cnow is the last moment of one\u2019s life\u201d urges us to put our entire being into the present moment. It means living each day wholeheartedly. It means to strive our hardest and give our all to achieve kosen-rufu and attain Buddhahood in this lifetime.\n\nEven when it comes to sharing Buddhism with someone, if you allow the present opportunity to slip by, you never know if you will ever have another chance to talk to that person at length. Also, if you interact with people in earnest, based on the awareness that this is your only chance to help them transform their karma, you are already living with the spirit that \u201cnow is the last moment of one\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nWhether you are chanting to the Gohonzon, engaged in Buddhist study, or writing words of encouragement to your friends and fellow members\u2014the crucial thing is to devote yourself to that activity fully and wholly each moment.\n\nUpon reflection, life is nothing more than the accumulation of each present moment. If you are unable to make today fulfilling, you won\u2019t reap any positive results tomorrow. You can make the grandest long-term plans, but if you can\u2019t treasure each moment, those plans will just end as empty pipe dreams. Past causes and future results are all encapsulated in the true aspect of all phenomena*2 in the present moment, and a transformation in that single moment of life can both extinguish karmic impediments from the distant past and ensure good fortune that will continue into the eternal future.\n\nThis important passage from the Daishonin\u2019s writings teaches the principle for changing our karma, the key to which lies in establishing solid faith based on the insight that \u201cnow is the last moment of one\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nFrom a lecture on \u201cThe Heritage of the Ultimate Law of Life,\u201d published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, April 1977.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1The worlds of hell, hungry spirits, animals, asuras are known together as the four evil paths.

OTT, 141)\u2014this is time without beginning. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and the Gohonzon are also of time without beginning. Therefore, each moment we chant to the Gohonzon is time without beginning.\n\nFor us, every day in our lives is time without beginning. We are able to make our beings brim with the boundless life force of time without beginning. Every day, we make a fresh departure from the starting point of life\u2014time without beginning.\n\nThat\u2019s why the present moment is the most important. We mustn\u2019t dwell on the past. There is no need to. To put all our energy into the present moment, with great hope for the future\u2014that is the mark of a person who is wise in the way of living.\n*\nThis moment is time without beginning. Everything starts from now.\n\nThe past no longer exists. The future isn\u2019t here yet. All that exists is this present moment. And in a flash, the present becomes the past. It both exists and doesn\u2019t exist. It is empty, or ku, the state of non-substantiality. In this state, life continues, moment to moment. It exists nowhere aside from the moment. We experience happiness and unhappiness only in the moment.\n\nTo regard our life in this present moment as the result of past causes is to view things from the standpoint of the \u201ctrue effect\u201d\u2014that happened, followed by that, creating the present result. But to have that perspective alone does not engender hope. Instead, we should regard this present moment of life as the cause for manifesting a future effect. That cause is the \u201ctrue cause\u201d penetrating the innermost depths of one\u2019s life. It is not a superficial or outward cause.\n\nThe true cause sinks its roots deeply into one\u2019s life of time without beginning and, at the same time, pervades the entire Dharma realm. It is Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the great law that sets everything in the universe into motion, the boundless eternal life force that causes all things to emerge and develop. Therefore, each moment that we believe in the Gohonzon, chant the Mystic Law, and engage in Buddhist practice is itself time without beginning.\n\nThe pure, boundless life force of time without beginning\u2014\u201cthat was not worked for, that was not improved upon, but that exists just as it always has\u201d\u2014wells up within us. We can savor complete freedom in the present and the future. Nichiren Buddhism is the Buddhism of hope.\n\nFaith in the Mystic Law is a source of infinite hope. No matter how adverse your present circumstances may be, even if it seems you have been defeated, it\u2019s important that you stand up with strong resolve to turn your situation around and demonstrate the limitless transformative potential of the Mystic Law. This is the essence of faith.\n\nOnly with all-out effort, with the determination to create something from nothing, can we understand genuine faith. The intense, arduous struggle of creating value\u2014turning loss into benefit, evil into good, baseness into beauty\u2014is the Soka Gakkai spirit and the essence of our practice of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nFrom The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra, vols. 5 and 6, published in Japanese in September 1999 and August 2000.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Thirty-two features and eighty characteristics: Extraordinary features attributed to Buddhas and bodhisattvas.

Toynbee. Professor Toynbee was 84 at the time. Yet even at that advanced age, with his motto Laboremus (Latin for \u201cLet\u2019s get to work!\u201d), he energetically continued to apply himself to his scholarly research day after day.\n\nI still clearly remember his words on that subject. He said that he kept regular hours, awaking every morning at 6:45. After preparing breakfast for himself and his wife and making his bed, he would start working at 9:00. In this simple description of his morning routine, I sensed his youthful spirit to treasure each day and keep learning and improving. His example also left me deeply impressed that truly outstanding individuals, no matter what their age or circumstances, remain tirelessly committed to the pursuit of learning and self-development.\n\nAt the same time, Professor Toynbee\u2019s words reminded me that a good start in the morning and a regular lifestyle are indispensable to making each day productive and fulfilling. Those who go on to achieve eminence invariably value these important basics.\n\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, Nichiren Daishonin states:\n\n\u201cNow Nichiren and his followers, who chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, are persons who \u2018lodge in the same place as the Thus Come One [the Buddha].\u2019 Therefore, Fu Ta-shih [a venerated lay Buddhist in China] says in his commentary, \u2018Morning after morning we rise up with the Buddha, evening after evening we lie down with the Buddha.\u2019\u201d (OTT, 83)\n\nAs disciples of Nichiren Daishonin, we chant and practice the Mystic Law, day after day. As such, each one of us rises and rests together with the Buddha [that is, the Gohonzon].\n\nFirst, our practice of morning and evening gongyo is the foundation for advancing on the correct path of life\u2014a path aligned with the Law that pervades the three existences of past, present, and future\u2014leading the most meaningful existence. Especially important, as the phrase \u201cmorning after morning we rise up with the Buddha\u201d indicates, is doing an invigorating morning gongyo.\n\nFailing to win in the morning can lead to an unsatisfactory day. And an unending succession of such days can add up to an unsatisfying life. On the other hand, winning in the morning, getting off to a good start, leads to a productive day and puts you on a path to solid progress, ultimately culminating in a life of fulfillment and victory.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to win in the morning and get the day off to a refreshing start. This is something young people, especially, should challenge, for it is a source of victory and growth in all spheres.\n\nMr. Toda was very strict about getting to work on time. And as a businessman of exceptional talent, he was keenly aware of the importance of a well-disciplined life. I fondly remember his many comments regarding work. He said that a workplace where everyone brims with a fresh and vibrant spirit and resolve at the start of the work day is sure to grow. And he always insisted that the top person in the workplace should be the first to arrive, instilling in their coworkers a sense of responsibility and enthusiasm about their jobs. Doing so, he said, would also ensure the success of the work they were doing and of the business as a whole. When those in positions of responsibility are late to work and many lower-level employees grow equally lax about coming into work on time, he warned, the business will have problems and eventually decline.\n\nThese strict yet spot-on observations are the result of Mr. Toda\u2019s many years of firsthand business experience.\n\nMr. Toda himself was never late. He always came into the office, except when away on a business trip or some other special circumstance. Because of that, we, his employees, could never be late, either. Each morning was like a battle as I struggled frantically to make it to work on time. Sometimes, I even secretly wished that he\u2019d be late. But that wish was always in vain!\n\nThose days were really hard, but today I am deeply grateful for the valuable training they provided me.\n\nI worked for Mr. Toda for about 10 years, doing everything I could to support and assist him. During that time, I was late for work two or three times for health reasons.\n\nIn those early years of our movement, Soka Gakkai meetings often went much later into the night than they do now and we often got home very late as a result. But Mr. Toda never accepted Soka Gakkai activities as an excuse for being late for work. He dismissed that as abusing one\u2019s faith.\n\nHe also insisted that the higher one\u2019s position in the organization, the greater one\u2019s responsibility, and the more important it is to set an example. He also sternly warned against leaders talking big but failing to follow up with concrete action, decrying it as a disgrace and inexcusable self-indulgence.\n\nIt\u2019s important for leaders to first be exemplary models for others, winning in the morning and getting each day off to a refreshing start.\n\nFaith is manifested in daily life, and Buddhism finds expression in society. It would be truly regrettable if, though one practices Buddhism, one kept chaotic hours and it had a negative impact on one\u2019s workplace. Such an example would likely cause people to question the validity of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nEach of us must strive to demonstrate the greatness of Nichiren Buddhism in society and win trust and understanding from those around us. We must set an example, so those who know us will say: \u201cPeople who practice that Buddhism are really different from others. They are outstanding.\u201d Those who win the unshakable trust of the people around them may be called genuine practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nMr. Toda also said: \u201cBeing late for work is a sign that something is amiss in our Buddhist practice. Constantly making excuses will lead to lying and deviousness, and you will destroy people\u2019s faith in you. The next thing you know, you\u2019ll take a serious misstep, and you\u2019ll end up quitting your practice altogether.\u201d\n\nSmall things matter. Right or wrong, small things accumulate and lead to a major difference in the results. That\u2019s why the best way to achieve your important future goals is to pay careful attention to your minor daily challenges, and triumph in each one of them.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cIf a person cannot manage to cross a moat ten feet wide, how can he cross one that is a hundred or two hundred feet?\u201d (WND-1, 766). Small challenges, small successes, repeated again and again, become great victories and flower into a life of glorious success.\n\nFrom a speech at a Chubu Region leaders meeting, Aichi, March 28, 1988.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 17: Making the Most of Each Day [17.4]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 17: Making the Most of Each Day [17.6]"}, {"title": "chapter-17-6.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 17: Making the Most of Each Day [17.6]\n17.6 \u201cStrengthen Your Faith Day by Day and Month after Month\u201d\nPresident Ikeda teaches that to live each day valuably, we need to banish the inertia that can all too easily take root in our hearts.\n\nFaith is a constant struggle against inertia.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cStrengthen your faith day by day and month after month. Should you slacken in your resolve even a bit, devils will take advantage\u201d (WND-1, 997). He also says: \u201cBe ever diligent in your faith so that your desire will be fulfilled\u201d (WND-1, 452).\n\nNot advancing is retreating. Mr. Toda also constantly warned against having a lax attitude in our faith and practice. He said:\n\n\u201cEverything in the universe, from the stars and planets to the smallest insect, is constantly changing. Nothing remains the same for a single moment. The crucial question, therefore, is whether we are changing for the better or changing for the worse. When we fail to realize this, we give in to inertia. In other words, the frightening thing about succumbing to inertia is that we are completely oblivious and indifferent to whether we are changing for the better or the worse. Moreover, when we grow apathetic in faith, practicing only out of force of habit, it\u2019s the same as if we have stopped practicing altogether. Faith in Nichiren Buddhism is an active practice for rapidly changing ourselves for the better.\u201d\n\nNot advancing is not just stagnating; it is regressing. There is no \u201cthis will do\u201d in the realm of faith. Complacence gives rise to inertia and can lead one to stop practicing.\n\nIn a letter of encouragement to Sage Nichimyo, a female follower who had made the perilous journey to visit him on Sado Island, the Daishonin writes: \u201cI know your faith has always been admirable, but now you must strengthen it more than ever. Only then will the ten demon daughters*1 [guardian deities of Buddhism] lend you even greater protection\u201d (WND-1, 614).\n\nNo matter how unsparingly we may have exerted ourselves in faith in the past, if our commitment grows lax or apathetic, the protection of the heavenly deities\u2014the positive forces of the universe\u2014will weaken. Not only that, but we run the risk of erasing all the good fortune we have thus far accumulated. That\u2019s why the Daishonin urged Sage Nichimyo to keep on strengthening her resolve in faith even more.\n\nThroughout his writings, the Daishonin often uses the phrase \u201cmore than ever\u201d in encouraging his followers in their Buddhist practice. Encouraging Shijo Kingo, who demonstrated his selfless commitment to faith at the time of the Tatsunokuchi Persecution,*2 the Daishonin writes: \u201cStrengthen your power of faith more than ever\u201d (WND-1, 681), and \u201cYou must strengthen your faith more than ever\u201d (WND-1, 953). The passage I quoted earlier, \u201cStrengthen your faith day by day and month after month\u201d (WND-1, 997), was also addressed as encouragement to Shijo Kingo and other disciples.\n\nInertia, however, is often difficult to recognize in ourselves. Being unaware of it is perhaps one of its defining characteristics and causes.\n\nSomeone once came up with a list of \u201csymptoms\u201d for stagnation in faith, which included such things as: having only vague goals and determinations; doing gongyo, but having no specific prayers while chanting; doing gongyo and Soka Gakkai activities passively, out of a sense of obligation; being prone to complain; feeling no joy, enthusiasm, or gratitude; having a weak seeking spirit; being lax at one\u2019s job and forgetting the importance of putting one\u2019s faith into practice in daily life.\n\nI think we can all no doubt identify with these tendencies to some extent. We are only human, after all, and therefore not perfect. But the Daishonin warns us: \u201cIf your faith weakens and you do not attain Buddhahood in this lifetime, do not reproach me\u201d (WND-1, 1030).\n\nOur Buddhist practice is not an obligation, but a right that enables us to attain happiness. We will gain benefit in direct proportion to our own determination and efforts in faith.\n\nFrom a speech at a representatives conference, Tokyo, March 15, 1992.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Ten demon daughters: The ten female protective deities who appear in the \u201cDharani\u201d (26th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra as the \u201cdaughters of rakshasa demons\u201d or the \u201cten rakshasa daughters.\u201d They vow to the Buddha to guard and protect the sutra\u2019s practitioners.\n*2Tatsunokuchi Persecution: The failed attempt, instigated by powerful government figures, to behead the Daishonin under the cover of darkness on the beach at Tatsunokuchi, on the outskirts of Kamakura, on September 12, 1271.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 17: Making the Most of Each Day [17.5]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 17: Making the Most of Each Day [17.7]"}, {"title": "chapter-17-7.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 17: Making the Most of Each Day [17.7]\n17.7 \u201cOne Day of Life Is More Valuable Than All the Treasures of the Major World System\u201d\nPresident Ikeda\u2019s motto is living each day to the fullest.

The latter entails sharing the Mystic Law based on deep respect for others\u2019 lives and a heartfelt wish for their happiness.\n\nPractice for others is not limited to teaching people about Buddhist principles and ideals. President Ikeda explains that it includes warmly encouraging others through dialogue and thoughtful actions that embody the spirit of respect for all people and the dignity of life taught in the Lotus Sutra. And it means to inspire others by demonstrating real improvement in every aspect of our lives, that is, through our human revolution.\n\nPresident Ikeda has himself engaged people around the world in countless inspiring dialogues, always basing his words on the principles of Nichiren Buddhism. This chapter features selections of his guidance on conducting such dialogue.\n\nBuddhism is essentially a teaching of dialogue. Its enormous body of scriptures, known as the \u201ceighty thousand teachings,\u201d originated in Shakyamuni\u2019s candid dialogues with people from all walks of life.\n\nShakyamuni\u2019s first sermon, the \u201cfirst turning of the wheel of the Law,\u201d was by no means a solitary discourse delivered from on high. It was a frank and open conversation with five old friends, fellow human beings who for a time had pursued the truth of life along with him.\n\nThese former companions did not immediately accept what he said, just because he claimed to have attained enlightenment. Shakyamuni did not produce any miracle to convince them either. What he did was patiently continue to engage them in dialogue. He spoke with them again and again, over what appears to have been several days, until they were satisfied.\n\nFinally, one of his friends, Ajnata Kaundinya,*1 grasped what Shakyamuni was saying, and the other four soon followed. It wasn\u2019t all five at once. Only one person understood at first.\n\nThis is the important point\u2014whether we can get our message across to one other person and gain their understanding. Everything starts from there.\n\nSoon after embarking on his \u201cjourney of dialogue,\u201d Shakyamuni encountered a youth who was wandering through a grove of trees and lamenting about his problems. Shakyamuni called to him: \u201cYoung man, there are no worries here. Come here and sit down with me.\u201d He urged the youth to sit down beside him and join him in conversation.*2\n\nShakyamuni was always a friend to the suffering and seekers of the way.\n\nOne of the meanings of maitri, the Sanskrit word for compassion, is \u201cfriendliness.\u201d An early Buddhist scripture describes Shakyamuni\u2019s manner of interacting with people as \u201cwelcoming and hospitable, friendly in speech, happy to see others, always pleasant and bright, and eager to greet others before they greet him.\u201d*3\n\nHe didn\u2019t receive people with a scowl as if to say, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d or a cold superiority. Though dignified, he had an openness that made him approachable.\n\nThat\u2019s why all kinds of people\u2014farmers, merchants, people of learning, members of the nobility, and rulers\u2014wanted to meet him. Whether it was to share their troubles or to challenge him in debate, everyone eagerly wanted to speak with Shakyamuni.\n\nThe Soka Gakkai, too, is a forum for dialogue where we can talk with one another about anything. That\u2019s why so many gather for our lively meetings and activities.\n\nSpeaking on equal terms with anyone was, in fact, quite radical in India during Shakyamuni\u2019s time. The caste system governed society, dividing the population into many classes, with Brahmans at the top.\n\nBut Shakyamuni was equally respectful to everyone he encountered. For example, when one man of low caste\u2014who had been long despised and reviled\u2014sought to become his disciple, Shakyamuni welcomed him by addressing him with a title conveying his utmost respect.*4\n\nIn this world, where all things are impermanent, no one\u2014whether a ruler or an ordinary citizen\u2014can escape the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death. Shakyamuni always focused on this reality of human existence.\n\nOnce, the king of Kosala*5 came to see Shakyamuni after a long absence, saying he had been busy with affairs of the realm. Shakyamuni asked what the king would do if he saw a mountain high as the clouds about to crumble and destroy his kingdom, and there was no escape. The king replied that in such a case, no worldly power would be of use, and he would devote his remaining time to doing good. That mountain, Shakyamuni responded, is none other than aging and death.*6\n\nShakyamuni\u2019s dialogues were a means for seeking, along with the many people he met, the true way to live.\n\nA husband who complained about his wife\u2019s practice of Buddhism and a stubborn man with a cantankerous nature both regained the humility to reflect on their lives after meeting and speaking with Shakyamuni.*7\n\nOne day, a farmer who had been working in his fields said to Shakyamuni sarcastically: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you work as I do, plowing and sowing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI, too, am plowing and sowing,\u201d replied Shakyamuni to the farmer\u2019s astonishment. \u201cMy seeds are faith, and I cultivate with the plow of wisdom. My harvest is deliverance from all cares.\u201d*8\n\nThis superb metaphor would surely touch the heart of anyone doing farm work.\n\nOn another occasion, Shakyamuni encountered a woman weeping in a forest, calling out the name of her deceased daughter.*9\n\n\u201cWoman, understand yourself,\u201d said Shakyamuni, uttering words that would later be echoed by Socrates, when he said, \u201cKnow thyself.\u201d\n\nShakyamuni patiently told her: \u201cThere are many daughters of the name you call who were cremated in these woods. Which of them are you calling?\u201d\n\nShakyamuni\u2019s question moved the desolate, grief-stricken woman, helping her realize that she was not alone in her suffering.\n\n\u201cAh, you have drawn out the dart, so hard to find, that was in my heart,\u201d she said, drying her tears and making a fresh resolve to seek the Buddha way.\n\nShakyamuni says in the Lotus Sutra that he widely expounded his teachings \u201cthrough various causes and various similes\u201d (LSOC2, 56) as appropriate to people\u2019s differing capacities to understand the Law. In this respect, his dialogues were an expression of great artistry.\n\nThus, Buddhism has always been a religion of dialogue and, as such, a religion of genuine humanity.\n\nMay you all be openhearted experts of dialogue and courageous champions who communicate the truth! These are the honors of practitioners of Buddhist humanism, who will usher in an age of dialogue in the 21st century.\n\nNichiren Daishonin urges: \u201cTeach others to the best of your ability, even if it is only a single sentence or phrase\u201d (WND-1, 386). Therefore, let us forge ahead, keeping the flame of dialogue forever burning bright!\n\nFrom an essay series \u201cThoughts on The New Human Revolution,\u201d published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, March 8, 2002.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Ajnata Kaundinya: One of the five ascetics who heard Shakyamuni Buddha\u2019s first sermon and thereupon converted to his teachings. He was born to a Brahman family of Kapilavastu in northern India. When Shakyamuni renounced the secular world, Kaundinya and four others accompanied him at the order of Shakyamuni\u2019s father, King Shuddhodana, and practiced austerities together with him. When Shakyamuni discarded his ascetic practice, however, they abandoned him and left for Deer Park. After Shakyamuni attained enlightenment, Kaundinya and the others again encountered the Buddha at Deer Park and embraced his teachings.\n*2Cf.

In discussing the fourth guideline, \u201cEngage in dialogue to foster friendship and humanistic ideals,\u201d he urged members to confidently talk with others about Buddhism.\n\nDialogue is extremely important in the realm of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nThe Daishonin writes: \u201cThis saha world*1 is a land in which one gains the way through the faculty of hearing\u201d (WND-2, 87). Enabling people to hear about the Mystic Law and form a connection with Buddhism is carrying out the incredibly noble work of the Buddha. Your dialogues are the best possible way to expand our network of happiness and good.\n\nThe Daishonin clearly states: \u201c[Having] heard the Lotus Sutra, which leads to Buddhahood, with this as the seed, one will invariably become a Buddha\u201d (WND-1, 882); and \u201cOne should by all means persist in preaching the Lotus Sutra and causing [others] to hear it\u201d (WND-1, 882). We must not spare our voices in sharing with many others the supreme teaching [of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo]. Through such efforts, we help connect them to the Mystic Law, a cause for their eternal happiness. And we create a personal chronicle that brims with everlasting good fortune. As the Daishonin says: \u201cSingle-mindedly chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and urge others to do the same; that will remain as the only memory of your present life in this human world\u201d (WND-1, 64).\n\nIn particular, we mustn\u2019t be afraid to speak to others about what we know to be right. The Daishonin instructs: \u201cYou must act and speak without the least servility\u201d (WND-1, 824). The confidence to share the true greatness of the Mystic Law is the spirit of propagation in Nichiren Buddhism, the Soka Gakkai spirit, and the spirit of kosen-rufu. Our members\u2019 proud conviction made our organization what it is today.\n\nDiscussing the essence of dialogue, Mr. Toda said: \u201cSincerely sharing the truth with others and expressing what\u2019s in our hearts\u2014these are the principles that gave birth to the Soka Gakkai and are the driving force of its development.\u201d He also said: \u201cImportant is humanistic dialogue that fosters genuine heart-to-heart communication, friendship, and understanding of different cultures.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he taught me: \u201cJust launching into an abstract discussion of difficult Buddhist principles doesn\u2019t necessarily contribute to people\u2019s understanding of Buddhism. Sometimes it\u2019s better to take a more creative and flexible approach and spread the profound teachings of Nichiren Daishonin by expanding the scope of our discussion to literature, music, and art.\u201d\n\nCherishing my mentor\u2019s instructions, I have done my utmost to reach out to people in dialogue and transcend all barriers. Together with my wife, Kaneko, I have opened paths of dialogue and built bridges of friendship in countries and regions across the globe. This is a precious legacy that I bequeath to all of you.

Often translated as the world of endurance. In Sanskrit, saha means the earth; it derives from a root meaning \u201cto bear\u201d or \u201cto endure.\u201d For this reason, in the Chinese versions of Buddhist scriptures, saha is rendered as endurance. In this context, the saha world indicates a world in which people must endure suffering.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.1]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.3]"}, {"title": "chapter-18-3.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.3]\n18.3 Buddhist Dialogue Shines with the Light of Human Revolution\nPresident Ikeda teaches that talking to others about the Mystic Law means having deep respect for their lives, learning from them, and growing together. Our concern, prayers, and one-to-one dialogues for others\u2019 happiness, he says, are a shining reflection of our own human revolution.\n\nIt is through talking and interacting with others that we truly develop as human beings. Dialogue means learning from and respecting others, which makes heartfelt conversation possible. Learning from others enriches us. In such rich discussion, there is joy, happiness, and peace.\n\nDialogue is itself a sign of human triumph.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cNow, . . . we have entered the Latter Day of the Law, and the daimoku that I, Nichiren, chant is different from that of earlier ages. This Nam-myoho-renge-kyo encompasses both practice for oneself and the teaching of others\u201d (WND-2, 986).\n\nThis past year, chanting powerful daimoku, our youth division members have exerted themselves tirelessly and engaged in dialogue spurred by a wish for the welfare of their friends and communities.\n\nEvery day, I receive exciting reports of their personal victories: dialogues pursued for years finally producing results or someone\u2019s first success in having a friend start to practice Nichiren Buddhism. Such reports from young people who are challenging themselves give me immense hope. Nothing inspires or encourages everyone more than the fresh dynamism of youth. Young people are the ones who create the future.\n\nOf course, sometimes a friend with whom you talk about Buddhism may react negatively or emotionally, or you may find it difficult to help someone gain an understanding of our movement. As the Daishonin writes, to share the Mystic Law is to practice just as the Buddha teaches. It is the most difficult of all undertakings. But we gain the same benefit from enabling someone to hear about the correct teaching whether or not they immediately take faith in it. In either case, we are carrying out the supremely noble work of the Buddha.\n\nThere is no need to worry or feel bad if you don\u2019t achieve the results you hoped for. I have experienced the same thing myself. Again and again, I have wondered how best to communicate my message and reach another person. Once a friend sent back all the letters I had written him out of my sincere wish for his welfare. I felt sad and frustrated at the time, but now it is a fond memory of my youth. As you go through life, you will no doubt more keenly appreciate these words of the Daishonin: \u201cSingle-mindedly chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and urge others to do the same; that will remain as the only memory of your present life in this human world\u201d (WND-1, 64).\n\nEach day you chant and take action this way is a day of wonderful self-development, enabling you to turn even severe challenges into sources of growth. Such efforts form a shining foundation of faith in the depths of your life.\n\nBodhisattva Never Disparaging*1 bowed respectfully to everyone he met and greeted them to the effect: \u201cI have profound reverence for you, because you will practice the bodhisattva way and be able to attain Buddhahood\u201d (cf. LSOC20, 308). People responded to this with hostility, however. They showered him with curses and abuse and attacked him with sticks and stones.\n\nRespect met with antagonism\u2014this shows how firmly rooted people\u2019s resistance can be to spiritual transformation that awakens the dormant Buddha nature deep in their lives. But even if we at first encounter resistance, sharing the greatness of the Mystic Law with others creates a connection that activates their Buddha nature. We have made a cause for their eventual attainment of Buddhahood. This is the principle of the poison-drum relationship.*2\n\nNothing is ever wasted in our efforts for kosen-rufu. Abandoning our actions to share the Mystic Law because someone\u2019s reaction disheartens us would be the very opposite of compassion. The Daishonin cites the Lotus Sutra passage: \u201cThe seeds of Buddhahood sprout through causation, and for this reason they preach the single vehicle [the Mystic Law]\u201d (LSOC2, 75; cf. WND-1, 1117). The more we help others form a connection with Buddhism, the more we expand the scope of our movement for kosen-rufu. The spirit to sincerely care about others\u2019 happiness and well-being is the spirit of the Buddha. This spirit itself is a shining reflection of a great human revolution.\n\nFrom an essay series \u201cOur Brilliant Path to Victory,\u201d published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, December 15, 2010.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Bodhisattva Never Disparaging: Described in the \u201cBodhisattva Never Disparaging\u201d (20th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra. This bodhisattva\u2014Shakyamuni in a previous lifetime\u2014lived at the end of the Middle Day of the Law, after the death of the Buddha Awesome Sound King. He would bow to everyone he met and say: \u201cI have profound reverence for you, I would never dare treat you with disparagement or arrogance. Why? Because you will all practice the bodhisattva way and will then be able to attain Buddhahood\u201d (LSOC20, 308). However, he was attacked by arrogant people, who beat him with sticks and staves and threw stones at him. The sutra explains that this practice became the cause for Bodhisattva Never Disparaging to attain Buddhahood.\n*2Poison-drum relationship: Also, a reverse relationship. A bond formed with the Lotus Sutra by opposing or slandering it. One who opposes the Lotus Sutra when it is preached will still form a relationship with it by virtue of opposition and will thereby attain Buddhahood eventually. A \u201cpoison drum\u201d is a mythical drum daubed with poison; this is a reference to a statement in the Nirvana Sutra that once the poison drum is beaten, all those who hear it will die, even if they are not of the mind to listen to it. Similarly, when the correct teaching is preached, both those who embrace it and those who oppose it will equally receive the seeds of Buddhahood, and even those who oppose it will attain Buddhahood eventually. In this analogy, the \u201cdeath\u201d that results from hearing the correct teaching is the death of illusion or earthly desires. This metaphor is used to illustrate the benefit of even a reverse relationship with Buddhism.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.2]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.4]"}, {"title": "chapter-18-4.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.4]\n18.4 Sharing Buddhism Begins with Our Prayers for Others\u2019 Happiness\nIn a discussion on the practice of shakubuku stressed by Nichiren Daishonin in his writings, President Ikeda explains the essence of talking to others about Buddhism as Soka Gakkai members in contemporary times and the \u201cbenefit of rejoicing on hearing the Law,\u201d a concept described in the Lotus Sutra.\n\nShakubuku*1 is sharing the truth. Because the Lotus Sutra teaches the truth, it is known as the \u201cteaching of shakubuku.\u201d *2\n\nNow, in the Latter Day of the Law, all our efforts to communicate and spread the greatness of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u2014the essence of the Lotus Sutra\u2014constitute shakubuku.\n\nShakubuku doesn\u2019t mean picking fights with people. Telling others about the Mystic Law is an expression of compassion.\n\nChanting for those you speak with about Buddhism to understand your sincere concern for them is very important. Chanting gives rise to wisdom. It produces conviction and joy. Introducing Buddhism to others is challenging, but when you remember that your efforts to do so will lead both those individuals and you yourself to happiness, nothing could be more enjoyable.\n\nMr. Toda often said: \u201cSharing Buddhism shouldn\u2019t be something painful or unpleasant. It should be done with joy.\u201d\n\nSome of those you talk with about Buddhism may immediately decide to take faith and start practicing, but others may not. There\u2019s no need to worry. In both cases, your sincere prayers for others and your effort to share Buddhism with them produce enormous benefits. And precisely because it\u2019s so challenging, you can tap your inner wisdom and grow as a person. When you sow seeds, flowers are sure to blossom in time.\n\nThe key is to talk to people joyfully, filled with appreciation and pride that we can serve as envoys of the Buddha.\n*\nCompassion isn\u2019t about someone taking pity on the less fortunate from a position of superiority. It is egalitarian, not hierarchical. It is a feeling of empathy for another, equal human being. Its foundation is respect.\n\nDiscussing and pursuing the truth together as equals, as fellow human beings, and together awakening to a more genuine, meaningful way of life\u2014that interaction itself is the essence of shakubuku, of sharing the Mystic Law.\n\nIn \u201cOn Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land,\u201d the Daishonin describes the \u201chost\u201d who engages the \u201cguest\u201d in dialogue as \u201ca friend in the orchid room.\u201d*3 In a room filled with orchids, the flowers\u2019 sweet fragrance permeates the clothing of those who enter. In the same way, our dialogues on Buddhism should envelop others with the sweet fragrance of compassion.\n\nSharing Buddhism does not mean forcing our beliefs on others, nor is it for the sake of the organization. Because it means venerating each person\u2019s inherent Buddhahood, it is an act of the highest respect.\n\nMr. Toda often said: \u201cDeep empathy is the essence of shakubuku.\u201d Compassion is the foundation. We should never try to spread Buddhism by arguing with people, forcing our views upon them, or by taking a confrontational stance.\n\nIt\u2019s not dialogue when you interrupt or insist on your own conclusions. You need to be broad-minded enough to listen patiently without objecting to each little point you might disagree with. That will put the other person at ease and encourage them to listen to what you have to say.\n\nIn this sense, Buddhas are true masters of dialogue. Shakyamuni and the Daishonin were without a doubt the kind of individuals whose mere presence brought joy and comfort to others. That\u2019s why people eagerly listened to their words.\n\nA certain sutra recounts the following story about Shakyamuni.*4 A person named Upali, a follower of the Jain religion, tried to defeat Shakyamuni in a debate. But he was so moved by Shakyamuni\u2019s character and wisdom that he asked to be allowed to join the Buddhist community.\n\nNevertheless, Shakyamuni, rather than taking pride in winning Upali over, told him to stop and think the matter over carefully.\n\nImpressed even more, Upali confessed: \u201cVenerable sir, I have heard that you have said, \u2018Offerings should be given to me only, not to others. Offerings should be given to my disciples, not to the disciples of others. Offerings made to me or my disciples are of great fruit, but not the offerings made to others.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut now, Upali said, he realized that Shakyamuni would never be so narrow-minded as to make such arbitrary demands, and he begged yet again to be allowed to join the Buddhist order.\n\nWhen Upali\u2019s Jain teacher learned of this, he visited Upali\u2019s home with a contingent of his disciples. Upali welcomed them hospitably, but his former Jain teacher called him a fool for setting out to vanquish Shakyamuni in debate only to end up being enticed by Shakyamuni and converting to Buddhism.\n\nUpali replied calmly and courteously: \u201cSir, such an enticement is good. My dear ones and blood relations, all Brahmans and nobles, should be enticed by those enticements. For that would be for their happiness and welfare for a long time.\u201d\n*\nI once asked Mr. Toda if teaching others about the Mystic Law is, in effect, teaching ourselves. He replied: \u201cTo teach others about the Mystic Law requires that we ourselves live our lives based on Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. There is no other way to communicate the greatness of Buddhism. There isn\u2019t any special technique or method for us to master. Propagating the Mystic Law in the Latter Day of the Law . . . means deciding, \u2018My life is none other than Nam-myoho-renge-kyo!\u2019\u201d*5\n\nHe also said: \u201cDeciding that you yourself are Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the ultimate shakubuku.\u201d His tone was firm, indicating he wished to tell young people the truth.\n*\nJoyous faith comes from the determination to practice just as the Daishonin teaches. All the Soka Gakkai\u2019s efforts have accorded with the spirit of the Daishonin\u2019s writings. That is why the true joy and benefits of upholding the Lotus Sutra are found only in the Soka Gakkai.\n\nIn short, there is no greater joy than a life dedicated to kosen-rufu, to propagating Buddhism. There is no greater joy than seeing others become happy through our efforts in dialogue to share the Mystic Law. And when we rejoice at others\u2019 happiness, our own lives become increasingly pure.\n\nThat is why it\u2019s important to talk to others about Buddhism without arrogance. Rather, we should do so filled with joy at our good fortune to have been born as human beings and to be able to share even one word about the teachings of Buddhism. That\u2019s what matters, not whether people listen to what we have to say.\n\nIn \u201cThe Benefits of Responding with Joy\u201d chapter of the Lotus Sutra, Shakyamuni teaches that those who invite others to hear the Law preached, and who share their seat with them where the Law is preached, acquire enormous benefit (cf. LSOC18, 288).*6 What incredible benefit, then, we will receive when we personally tell others about the teachings and principles of Buddhism!\n\nNo matter how the other person reacts, by praising and sharing the Mystic Law with them we attain benefit beyond measure. Realizing this is a source of great joy.\n\nIt is also important that we praise those who are working hard to share the Mystic Law with others. They are supremely noble envoys of the Buddha. Such praise brings joy to everyone, ourselves included, and further advances kosen-rufu.\n\nWhen our faith is so strong that we love the Gohonzon, love daimoku, and love Soka Gakkai activities, the \u201cbenefits of responding with joy\u201d will flow forth limitlessly in our lives.\n\nFrom The Wisdom of the Lotus Sutra, vols. 2 and 5, published in Japanese in November 1996 and September 1999.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Shakubuku: A method of expounding Buddhism by refuting another\u2019s attachment to erroneous teachings and thus leading that person to the correct teaching. The term \u201cshakubuku\u201d is used in contrast to \u201cshoju,\u201d which means to lead another gradually to the correct teaching in accord with that person\u2019s capacity. These two kinds of practice are described in the Shrimala Sutra, T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai\u2019s Great Concentration and Insight, and other works. In Nichiren Buddhism, the term \u201cshakubuku\u201d is also often used synonymously with propagating or sharing the Mystic Law.\n*2In \u201cOn Practicing the Buddha\u2019s teaching,\u201d Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cAnyone who practices Buddhism should first understand the two types of practice\u2014shoju and shakubuku. All the sutras and treatises fall into one or the other of these two categories. . . . In this age, the provisional teachings have turned into enemies of the true teaching. When the time is right to propagate the teaching of the one vehicle [the Lotus Sutra], the provisional teachings become enemies. When they are a source of confusion, they must be thoroughly refuted from the standpoint of the true teaching. Of the two types of practice, this is shakubuku, the practice of the Lotus Sutra. With good reason T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai stated, \u2018The Lotus Sutra is the teaching of shakubuku, the refutation of the provisional doctrines\u2019\u201d (WND-1, 394).\n*3In his treatise \u201cOn Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land,\u201d the Daishonin writes: \u201cHow gratifying! You have associated with a friend in the orchid room and have become as straight as mugwort growing among hemp\u201d (WND-1, 23). \u201cA friend in the orchid room\u201d indicates a person of virtue. The implication is that the company of a virtuous person works as a good influence, just as one is imbued with fragrance on entering a room filled with orchids.\n*4Cf. The Collection of the Middle Length Sayings (Majjhima-Nikaya), translated by I. B. Horner, vol. 2 (Oxford: Pali Text Society, 1994), pp. 38\u201349.\n*5Cf. Translated from Japanese. Josei Toda, Toda Josei zenshu (Collected Writings of Josei Toda), vol. 2 (Tokyo: Seikyo Shimbunsha, 1982), pp. 466\u201367.\n*6The Lotus Sutra states: \u201cSuppose there is a person who is sitting in the place where the Law is expounded, and when another person appears, the first person urges him to sit down and listen, or offers to share his seat and so persuades him to sit down. The benefits gained by this person will be such that when he is reborn he will be in a place where the lord Shakra is seated, where the heavenly king Brahma is seated, or where a wheel-turning sage king is seated\u201d (LSOC18, 288).\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.3]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.5]"}, {"title": "chapter-18-5.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.5]\n18.5 Perseverance and Compassion\nPresident Ikeda discusses essential aspects of sharing Buddhism to help guide people to happiness.\n\nConveying his powerful conviction as the votary of the Lotus Sutra, the Daishonin states: \u201cWhen it comes to understanding the Lotus Sutra, I have only a minute fraction of the vast ability that T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai and Dengyo possessed. But as regards my ability to endure persecution [or difficulties] and the wealth of my compassion for others, I believe they would hold me in awe\u201d (WND-1, 242).\n\nThough the great Buddhist teachers T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai and Dengyo may surpass him in terms of their depth of understanding of the Lotus Sutra, asserts the Daishonin, he outdoes them in terms of his perseverance and compassion.\n\nNaturally, in spreading the Mystic Law in the Latter Day, it is important to talk to others based on \u201cunderstanding the Lotus Sutra\u201d\u2014in other words, to present the sutra\u2019s teaching and doctrines in a logical and coherent fashion. So, in conceding that T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai and Dengyo provide lucid and rational theoretical explanations, the Daishonin is by no means rejecting the need for these things.\n\nMore important, however, are perseverance (that is, the ability to endure difficulties) and compassion. These are indispensable to actually spreading the Law in the evil age of the Latter Day and helping even those experiencing the greatest suffering attain genuine happiness. Perseverance and compassion are like two sides of the same coin. Profound compassion based on a wish to free all people from suffering gives one incomparable strength to endure difficulties and spread the Law.\n\nTo endure difficulties, to persevere amid obstacles, does not mean a state of passive acceptance. The Latter Day is an age when evil is rampant. Those aware of their mission to overcome such evil and awaken people to life\u2019s ultimate truth must be prepared to continue fighting through any obstacle or difficulty. Their actions are essentially motivated by a solemn, rigorous compassion not to let anyone in the Latter Day lead a life in which they disrespect or slander the Law, the essence of life itself. This unwavering compassion leads directly to the enlightenment of all people in the Latter Day.\n\nCompassion is the driving force behind perseverance, while perseverance is proof of deep compassion.\n\nFrom Lectures on \u201cThe Opening of the Eyes,\u201d published in Japanese in June 2006.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.4]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.6]"}, {"title": "chapter-18-6.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.6]\n18.6 The Key to Sharing Nichiren Buddhism\nPresident Ikeda discusses the importance of sharing Nichiren Buddhism with others, the essence of such dialogue, and the reason for Nichiren Daishonin refuting erroneous teachings in the realm of Buddhism during his lifetime.\n\nNichiren Buddhism thoroughly elucidates the essence of the struggle between the devilish nature and the Buddha nature within each person\u2019s life.\n\nFor the Daishonin, the four major persecutions*1 he encountered during his lifetime were battlefields on which this fundamental struggle unfolded. In each instance, he won a decisive victory. Buddhism is about winning.\n\nOnly through this fundamental struggle on the level of life itself can there be a change in the destiny of humankind. In this sense, in today\u2019s world where the characteristics of an \u201cage of conflict\u201d are in ever greater evidence, the engaged humanism of Nichiren Buddhism will be needed more and more.\n\nNichiren Buddhism is the Buddhism of mentor and disciple. The Daishonin himself first took the lead in shakubuku, sharing the Mystic Law, a practice of profound respect for the Buddha nature of oneself and others. He stood in the vanguard of the struggle for the Law and strove to defeat the workings of the devilish nature so that all people could reveal their Buddha nature. Later, prompted by the events at Tatsunokuchi and his subsequent exile to Sado,*2 the Daishonin began to strongly call on his disciples to take part in this great struggle to lead people to enlightenment. The period from the Sado Exile onward marked the time for his disciples to rise into action.\n\nTheir struggle was a battle against the devilish nature inherent in life. It was none other than the struggle of shakubuku, propagating the Mystic Law. I am convinced that the Soka Gakkai appeared today as well because the present age is also a decisive moment for this struggle.\n\nCarrying out shakubuku is an expression of our belief in the Buddha nature within ourselves and others. It is an act of profound humanity and the highest respect for others.\n*\nCompassion for others and conviction in the principles of Buddhism are the heart of shakubuku, or propagating the Mystic Law. Compassion is the spirit of the Buddha to relieve people from suffering. In terms of our own practice, compassion for others means concern for our friends\u2019 happiness and well-being; specifically, it manifests as tireless perseverance and the courage to talk to people in-depth about the correct teaching of Buddhism. Conviction in the principles of Buddhism means unshakable belief in the teachings of the Lotus Sutra, which proclaim that all people can attain Buddhahood and that everyone has the right to become happy.\n\nThe essence of shakubuku is the Buddha\u2019s fervent wish to enable all people to realize true happiness. To make this spirit one\u2019s own is the vow of genuine disciples who strive for kosen-rufu in the Latter Day; it is the vow of Bodhisattvas of the Earth.*3\n\nThe Japanese word for compassion is jihi. Ji means to love and guide people as one would one\u2019s own children, while hi means to feel sorrow for people\u2019s sufferings and share their pain as if it were one\u2019s own.\n\nWhen children are nurtured with both warm, embracing love and strict, guiding love, they will develop fine character and inner richness. If they\u2019re merely doted upon, they won\u2019t develop a spirit of self-reliance. Similarly, if they are stifled or repressed, they won\u2019t be able to fully express their individuality.\n\nEmbodying the virtue of the parent*4 in its diverse aspects, the Buddha guides people. The Buddha does not simply stop at relieving suffering, but teaches people the correct way of life and calls on them to transform their inner state of being and actually attain happiness. Shakubuku is none other than this compassionate practice of \u201cremoving suffering and imparting joy.\u201d*5\n*\nShakubuku means to teach others the universal truth. It is to courageously proclaim and proudly uphold it. Shakubuku is the struggle to establish and actualize the universal value and truth that all people should cherish. It definitely is not, and must not become, narrow-minded sectarianism.\n\nThe Lotus Sutra, because it directly expounds the truth of the Buddha\u2019s enlightenment, is generally regarded as the \u201cteaching of shakubuku.\u201d*6\n\nEach human being, without exception, is precious and irreplaceable. The Lotus Sutra thoroughly elucidates the truth of the sanctity of life and the supreme practice of respecting all people. Nichiren Daishonin, the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law, demonstrated this fundamental spirit of the Lotus Sutra in his own selfless practice in this troubled world. And he manifested it as \u201cNam-myoho-renge-kyo,\u201d which he inscribed as the Gohonzon for us to use as a mirror to reflect our inner lives.\n*\nIn \u201cOn Practicing the Buddha\u2019s Teachings\u201d and other writings, the Daishonin talks about the need to \u201crefute the enemies of the Lotus Sutra\u201d (cf. WND-1, 394). I would like to say something about this point to ensure that there is no misunderstanding.\n\nSometimes merely telling a person about the essence of Buddhism may put them on the defensive and strengthen their attachment to erroneous views. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we patiently pursue dialogue to clarify the truth and help them awaken to it. Of course, when a person\u2019s mistaken beliefs are so entrenched that they respond by berating and maligning us and the Law, then it is important to refute their attachments and explain where they are in error. Someone who neglects refuting that which denigrates the Law is not a disciple of Nichiren Daishonin. Losing the spirit to refute such error is to lose the very soul of the Soka Gakkai.\n\nBut \u201crefute\u201d certainly does not mean to engage in a quarrel or a shouting match, or to employ means other than discourse. It is to clarify what is true and what is false; specifically, it means asserting the correct teaching. Just pointing out that something is \u201cmistaken\u201d is not adequate. The person you\u2019re trying to convince will not be persuaded. It is only by explicitly indicating what is correct that we can enable people to take the first step toward changing their lives.\n\nCompassion is key.\n\nIn \u201cThe Opening of the Eyes,\u201d the Daishonin explains the significance of his own practice of shakubuku, that is, his efforts in propagating the Mystic Law and his strict refutation of the other Buddhist schools of his day. He cites a passage of the Great Teacher Chang-an of China that appears in the latter\u2019s annotation on the Nirvana Sutra. [The passage reads: \u201cOne who destroys or brings confusion to the Buddha\u2019s teachings is betraying them. If one befriends another person but lacks the mercy to correct him, one is in fact his enemy. But one who reprimands and corrects an offender is a voice-hearer who defends the Buddha\u2019s teachings, a true disciple of the Buddha. One who rids the offender of evil [or error] is acting as his parent. Those who reproach offenders are disciples of the Buddha. But those who do not oust offenders are betraying the Buddha\u2019s teachings\u201d (WND-1, 286).]\n\nThe Daishonin\u2019s practice of shakubuku was thoroughly rooted in his immense compassion to open the eyes of people deceived by erroneous teachings and to lead them to enlightenment. Likewise, our practice of shakubuku, or sharing the Mystic Law, must accord with the Daishonin\u2019s compassionate spirit; it must arise from our desire to lead others to happiness without fail.\n*\nThe \u201cBodhisattva Never Disparaging\u201d (20th) chapter is the only place in the essential teaching (or latter half) of the Lotus Sutra where Shakyamuni Buddha, after clarifying his actual attainment of enlightenment in the remote past, describes his own practices in a previous life. In view of that, we can conclude that the true cause of his original attainment of Buddhahood lies in the practice of Bodhisattva Never Disparaging.*7\n\nWith regard to this bodhisattva practice of bowing in reverence to others, in The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings the Daishonin comments on the statement in the \u201cLife Span\u201d chapter of the Lotus Sutra, \u201cOriginally I practiced the bodhisattva way\u201d (LSOC16, 268), saying:\n\n\u201cThe word \u2018I\u2019 here refers to Shakyamuni Buddha when he was carrying out the true cause of his original enlightenment. This passage concerning how the Buddha \u2018originally practiced the bodhisattva way\u2019 refers to the practice of the bodhisattva Never Disparaging [who was reborn as Shakyamuni]. Hence it indicates a place where the bow of obeisance [the practice of bowing in reverence to others] is carried out.\u201d (OTT, 161)\n\nWe can interpret this as meaning that Shakyamuni, who practiced the bodhisattva way over countless kalpas to attain his original enlightenment, is none other than Bodhisattva Never Disparaging. In the remote past, Shakyamuni awoke to the eternal Mystic Law that is inherent in the lives of all people, practiced it, and attained enlightenment.\n\nThrough awakening to the truth that the lives of all are precious as entities of the Mystic Law, he was able to elevate himself to the supreme life state of Buddhahood.\n\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, the Daishonin further says that Bodhisattva Never Disparaging\u2019s practice of veneration also corresponds to the passage in the \u201cLife Span\u201d chapter: \u201cAt all times I think to myself: / How can I cause living beings / to gain entry into the unsurpassed way / and quickly acquire the body of a Buddha?\u201d (LSOC16, 273).\n\nBoth before and after attaining enlightenment, the Buddha constantly yearns for the enlightenment of all people. For this is the eternal wish originally existing in the depths of the lives of all beings. We can take it that Bodhisattva Never Disparaging\u2019s determination and this spirit of the Buddha are identical.\n\nFrom these statements, we understand that the practice of Bodhisattva Never Disparaging\u2014namely, the practice of shakubuku\u2014is the direct path to attaining Buddhahood for ourselves and others, the noble practice that enables us to achieve true and lasting happiness for ourselves and others.\n\nIt was the Daishonin who actually conducted himself like Bodhisattva Never Disparaging, telling people about the essence of the Mystic Law and enduring fierce, life-threatening persecution. He showed people what it means to be a votary or practitioner of the Lotus Sutra and to practice the Lotus Sutra exactly as the Buddha teaches.\n\nRejecting practices that were only empty rhetoric or formality, the Daishonin put into practice the heart of Lotus Sutra and embodied it in his life. Through his noble conduct, he opened the way for all people to achieve eternal happiness.\n*\nThe foundation of everything is to become one with the spirit of the Buddha, the spirit of the Lotus Sutra. When we become one with the Buddha, when we attune our lives with the Mystic Law, there is no hardship we cannot overcome. The heart of the Buddha is defined by the deeply compassionate vow to lead all people to enlightenment. Through embracing this vow as our own and engaging in the great struggle to accomplish it, we can develop and strengthen our lives.\n\nOur practice of shakubuku has the power to break through the fundamental ignorance*8 inherent in our own lives and those of others. Only a diamond can polish a diamond. Similarly, only human beings can help other human beings bring forth the full brilliance of their potential. Sharing the Mystic Law with others is the key to leading a truly great life.\n\nLife, while seemingly long, is in fact brief. There is a limit to what we ourselves can experience in one lifetime. But when we regard the sufferings of others as our own, praying and struggling together with one person after another and achieving victory together with them, then the richness of our lives will expand\u2014twofold, threefold, tenfold, a hundredfold\u2014limitlessly!\n\nOnly to the extent that we concern ourselves with the problems and sufferings of others and work for others\u2019 happiness and well-being, can we accumulate \u201ctreasures of the heart\u201d (WND-1, 851) and establish a state of happiness in our own lives that no hardship or adversity can undermine.\n\nThe act of telling someone about Nichiren Buddhism is supremely noble; it creates the necessary condition for that person to attain enlightenment. That\u2019s why the benefit of doing so is immense.\n\nSecond Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda once commented on this as follows:\n\n\u201cThere are two kinds of seed sowing [in Buddhism]: sowing the seeds by letting people hear the teaching and sowing the seeds by leading people to arouse faith in the teaching. Let\u2019s say you meet someone for the first time and tell them about Nichiren Buddhism, but the person does not take faith. This is sowing the seeds by letting people hear the teaching. But suppose that later someone else who practices this Buddhism approaches that person and talks to them about faith in the Mystic Law again, and they decide to receive the Gohonzon. This is sowing the seeds by leading people to arouse faith in the teaching. Both of these are equally sowing the seeds of Buddhahood, and the benefit is the same.\u201d*9\n\nSowing the seeds by letting people hear the teaching and sowing the seeds by leading people to arouse faith in the teaching are both noble actions to teach people about the Mystic Law. In either case, our benefit in acting as an emissary of the Buddha of the Latter Day is boundless.\n\nHaving said this, however, the Daishonin particularly emphasizes the importance of sowing the seeds by letting people hear the teaching, which involves telling people about the Mystic Law and thereby enabling them to form a connection with Buddhism. He writes: \u201cOne should by all means persist in preaching the Lotus Sutra and causing them to hear it. Those who put their faith in it will surely attain Buddhahood, while those who slander it will establish a \u2018poison-drum relationship\u2019 with it and will likewise attain Buddhahood\u201d (WND-1, 882).\n\nA \u201cpoison-drum relationship\u201d is also known as a reverse relationship. This refers to the case in which, for instance, upon hearing about the Lotus Sutra, a person does not take faith at the time and instead disparages the teaching. Hearing about the correct teaching causes the person to form a relationship with it, and later on, to be able to attain Buddhahood without fail.\n\nThough someone may be unable to believe in the correct teaching right away, the time will definitely come when that person\u2014in whose life the seed has been sown as a result of hearing about the Mystic Law\u2014embraces faith in it. This is just as a seed once planted, given the right conditions, will eventually sprout.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether people take faith, the important thing is that we pray for their happiness, sincerely exert ourselves on their behalf, and courageously explain to them the greatness of Buddhism. The Daishonin continued to calmly proclaim the correct teaching without the least hesitation, even to those who treated him with enmity and brought political pressure and brute force to bear on him.\n\nThe behavior of the Buddha to thoroughly relieve people of suffering while never giving up on anyone exists in the practice to awaken people to the Mystic Law. The Soka Gakkai carries on this spirit and conduct of the Buddha. All who take part in this struggle are assured of receiving immeasurable benefit.\n\n\u201cChampion truth and your strength will be doubled\u201d\u2014this is a saying that I have engraved in my heart since my youth. No one is a match for a person who has stood up to champion what is right. No one is as strong as a person who upholds the truth.\n\nThe Daishonin writes: \u201c[Despite the personal interference of the devil king*10 of the sixth heaven,] it is because the heavenly deities came to my aid that I survived even the Tatsunokuchi Persecution and emerged safely from other great persecutions. By now, the devil king must be thoroughly discouraged\u201d (GZ, 843).*11\n\nThere are no stronger allies than the heavenly deities and the Buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout the universe. When we base ourselves on a steadfast commitment to what is true and right, the power of the vast universe surges through our entire being. Courage and wisdom well forth like a great torrent.\n\nThe Daishonin reveals his boundless, joy-filled state of life with the words: \u201cFor what I have done, I have been condemned to exile, but it is a small suffering to undergo in this present life and not one worth lamenting. In future lives I will enjoy immense happiness, a thought that gives me great joy\u201d (WND-1, 287).\n\nLikewise, let us be confident that through our own just actions to spread the Mystic Law in accord with the heart of Nichiren Daishonin, the Buddha of the Latter Day, we are creating good fortune and benefit as vast as the universe.\n\nFrom The World of Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s Writings, vol. 3,published in Japanese in 2005.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1The four major persecutions are: the Matsubagayatsu Persecution (1260), the Izu Exile (1261), the Komatsubara Persecution (1264), and the Tatsunokuchi Persecution and Sado Exile (1271).\n*2Tatsunokuchi Persecution was the failed attempt, instigated by powerful government figures, to behead the Daishonin under the cover of darkness on the beach at Tatsunokuchi, on the outskirts of Kamakura, on September 12, 1271. Shortly thereafter, he was exiled to Sado Island, which was tantamount to a death sentence. However, when his predictions of internal strife and foreign invasion were fulfilled, the government issued a pardon in March 1274, and he returned to Kamakura.\n*3Bodhisattvas of the Earth: An innumerable host of bodhisattvas who emerge from beneath the earth and to whom Shakyamuni Buddha entrusts the propagation of the Mystic Law, or the essence of the Lotus Sutra, in the Latter Day of the Law\n*4The virtue of the parent is one of the three virtues, or benevolent functions, a Buddha is said to possess. The other two are the virtues of the sovereign and the teacher. The virtue of the sovereign is the power to protect all living beings, the virtue of the teacher is the wisdom to instruct and lead them to enlightenment, and the virtue of the parent is the compassion to nurture and support them\n*5This indicates the supremely compassionate actions of the Buddha. The Treatise on the Great Perfection of Wisdom (vol. 27) says: \u201cGreat mercy (ji) means giving joy to all living beings. Great empathy (hi) means removing suffering from all living beings.\u201d Also, the Nirvana Sutra (vol. 15) says: \u201cRemoving harm and disadvantage from all living beings is called great mercy (ji). Imparting infinite benefit and joy to all people, this is called great empathy (hi).\u201d\n*6In \u201cOn Practicing the Buddha\u2019s teaching,\u201d Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cAnyone who practices Buddhism should first understand the two types of practice\u2014shoju and shakubuku. All the sutras and treatises fall into one or the other of these two categories. . . . In this age, the provisional teachings have turned into enemies of the true teaching. When the time is right to propagate the teaching of the one vehicle [the Lotus Sutra], the provisional teachings become enemies. When they are a source of confusion, they must be thoroughly refuted from the standpoint of the true teaching. Of the two types of practice, this is shakubuku, the practice of the Lotus Sutra. With good reason T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai stated, \u2018The Lotus Sutra is the teaching of shakubuku, the refutation of the provisional doctrines\u2019\u201d (WND-1, 394).\n*7Bodhisattva Never Disparaging: Described in the \u201cBodhisattva Never Disparaging\u201d (20th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra. This bodhisattva\u2014Shakyamuni in a previous lifetime\u2014lived at the end of the Middle Day of the Law, after the death of the Buddha Awesome Sound King. He would bow to everyone he met and say: \u201cI have profound reverence for you, I would never dare treat you with disparagement or arrogance. Why? Because you will all practice the bodhisattva way and will then be able to attain Buddhahood\u201d (LSOC20, 308). However, he was attacked by arrogant people, who beat him with sticks and staves and threw stones at him. The sutra explains that this practice became the cause for Bodhisattva Never Disparaging to attain Buddhahood.\n*8Fundamental ignorance: The most deeply rooted illusion inherent in life, said to give rise to all other illusions.

One of them said to me: \u201cI am having a hard time introducing Buddhism to my friends.\u201d This deeply troubled him, and his seriousness impressed me. Here he was, worrying about how he could teach Buddhism to his friends and thereby plant the seed of happiness in their lives. What a fine, noble thing to be concerned about!\n\nWith the greatest respect, I encouraged him with all my heart: \u201cEverything is hard in the beginning. This is only truer of propagating Buddhism, which the Daishonin\u2019s writings describe as the most difficult of all undertakings.\n\n\u201cWhen I was young, my efforts were just trial and error, but they became the foundation for future success. The important thing is to be determined, positive, and optimistic, and never stop challenging ourselves, no matter the circumstances. Let\u2019s be invincible optimists!\u201d\n\nI will never forget his face as he nodded with a smile.\n\nFive months later, he joyfully reported that he had successfully had a friend take up faith. I was so happy to hear that; I was happy because of his sincerity.\n\nLooking back, the first person to practice Buddhism through my introduction was an elementary school teacher who lived in my hometown, Ota. It happened shortly after I began working at Mr. Toda\u2019s company. Up to then, I had spoken about Buddhism with quite a few of my friends. Mr. Toda had even kindly met and talked with some of them. But so far, none had taken faith and begun to practice.\n\nFeeling incapable, I studied and practiced hard to develop my ability to speak about Buddhism. I chanted with all my heart and continued talking about Buddhism, driven by the wish to reach one more person, to connect with one more person. I can\u2019t begin to measure how much that helped me develop myself.\n\nHow delighted I was when I finally convinced someone to embrace Nichiren Buddhism! I could never describe my elation. I decided that I would thoroughly look after them and make sure that they triumphed in life. I invited them to my apartment before work in the morning, and we did gongyo and read the Daishonin\u2019s writings. I also remember how I used to stop by their place after work and teach them gongyo.\n\nThe development of kosen-rufu lies in repeating such patient, painstaking efforts to awaken one friend after another to faith. That is true Buddhist practice.\n\nWhen Mr. Toda became second Soka Gakkai president and made his vow to attain a membership of 750,000 households, I pledged: \u201cMr. Toda is a great teacher of propagation. As his disciple, I vow to become a champion of propagation!\u201d And having made that pledge, I threw myself wholeheartedly into the challenge, creating a groundswell for unprecedented propagation in Kamata, in Bunkyo, in Osaka, and in Yamaguchi.\n\nI remember one discussion meeting where all of the seven or eight young men attending as guests decided to join the Soka Gakkai. I told them that practicing Nichiren Buddhism was the key to absolute happiness, and I assured them that all I wanted was for each of them to have the best life possible.\n\nSuch conviction and sincerity will open our friends\u2019 hearts and make them receptive to our message.\n\nPropagation must always be a process of deepening friendship and earning trust. In today\u2019s world, superficial conversations abound, but genuine dialogue is rare. Sharing Nichiren Buddhism, however, is genuine dialogue\u2014a stimulating exchange based on deep consideration for our friends as we invite them to walk with us on the path of true and complete happiness.\n\nIn genuine Buddhist dialogue, we discuss such crucial matters as what is a valuable way to live and what constitutes right and wrong, at times speaking of our daily lives or personal experiences. Pursuing such dialogue is the noble path of humanity. It is the very heart of spreading the Mystic Law. At the same time, sharing Buddhism involves teaching others the fundamental solution to suffering; it is the ultimate act of altruism. And it is the direct path by which we can achieve our human revolution and break out of the shell of our ego.\n\nThose who spread the Mystic Law are true disciples of the Daishonin who carry on his spirit. Nikko Shonin [the Daishonin\u2019s direct disciple and successor] praised all who courageously propagated the Daishonin\u2019s teachings, declaring to the effect that we should revere as respected seniors in faith those teachers of the Law who engage in propagation, regardless of whether they are junior in years of Buddhist practice (cf. GZ, 1618).*1 And the benefits those who propagate the Law attain are boundless and immeasurable.\n\nOut of our concern for others\u2019 happiness and our desire for world peace, we have held high the banner of kosen-rufu and continued to shed the compassionate light of Buddhism throughout the world, undeterred by slander or abuse. This is the Soka Gakkai\u2019s proud and noble history.\n\nFrom an essay series \u201cThoughts on The New Human Revolution,\u201d published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, October 7, 1998.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Article 15 of \u201cThe Twenty-Six Admonitions of Nikko.\u201d Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s designated successor, Nikko Shonin, wrote the \u201cTwenty-Six Admonitions\u201d in 1333 for the sake of practitioners of future generations to maintain the purity of the Daishonin\u2019s teachings. It outlines the fundamental spirit of faith, practice, and study.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.6]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.8]"}, {"title": "chapter-18-8.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.8]\n18.8 The Ultimate Expression of Friendship\nIn The New Human Revolution, the novel\u2019s protagonist Shin\u2019ichi Yamamoto (whose character represents President Ikeda) often talks about the spirit and practice of Buddhist dialogue.\n\n[In a speech at a young women\u2019s division general meeting, held in November 1960]\n\nSome of you may feel you couldn\u2019t possibly introduce others to Nichiren Buddhism and successfully have them start practicing. That\u2019s OK. Even in President Makiguchi\u2019s and President Toda\u2019s day, the Soka Gakkai never once pleaded with its members to introduce Buddhism to others. The Daishonin promises that if we share the correct teaching with others, we can change our karma and attain Buddhahood. We therefore engage in propagation activities to transform our karma and become happy. Such efforts also contribute to our friends\u2019 happiness and a peaceful and prosperous society. No task is more sublime or sacred.\n\nSometimes, you may earnestly share this Buddhism with others but find it difficult to convince them to start practicing. But you are still young, so there\u2019s absolutely no need to be impatient or worry about results. Spreading the Daishonin\u2019s teachings is the most compassionate practice we can undertake as human beings\u2014a practice that simultaneously enables us to develop ourselves. Moreover, because it guides people to happiness and peace, it is the ultimate expression of friendship.\n\nWhat is important is to have the feeling \u201cThat person is suffering, I want them to be happy\u201d and also to talk about Buddhism with those around you from time to time. Even if the person you\u2019ve been talking with doesn\u2019t take faith right away, as long as you maintain a strong unwavering wish for their happiness and a sincere spirit of friendship, the time will definitely come when they will awaken to Buddhism.\n\nIt is also vital that leaders not pressure or rebuke members who worry about not being able to convince someone to start practicing. Instead, I want leaders to embrace such members warmly, praising and encouraging them for their earnest efforts to live as emissaries of the Buddha.\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 2, \u201cBanner of the People\u201d chapter.\n*\n[In response to a member who shared during a train ride in Hiroshima in April 1961: \u201cI have a hard time introducing others to this Buddhism . . . .\u201d]\n\nIt\u2019s the same for everyone. Propagation is the most difficult Buddhist practice. It\u2019s no simple matter. Teaching people the power of Nichiren Buddhism today is just as challenging as it would have been trying to teach people a thousand years ago about atomic energy or explain to them the wonders of radio and television. You can do your best to explain the teachings of Buddhism, but people still may not understand. However, once they try practicing it, they can appreciate how wonderful it is. Then, more often than not, they\u2019ll ask themselves why they didn\u2019t start practicing sooner. That is probably true of many of you. So the important thing is to treasure your friendships and persevere in your efforts to engage in dialogue.\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 4, \u201cTriumph\u201d chapter.\n*\n[In response to a men\u2019s division member who said: \u201cI\u2019m very busy with work and can\u2019t even take a day off. I really want to share Buddhism with others, but I haven\u2019t had much success and am feeling very frustrated.\u201d]\n\nTo be troubled about helping others is truly wonderful. It is the noblest and most respectworthy of problems, an expression of genuine compassion. It is the very concern of a Bodhisattva of the Earth and the Buddha.\n\nWhat is the key to enabling others to practice Nichiren Buddhism? It is determination. As long as you have firm resolve, you can transform any situation.\n\nYou can share this practice no matter where you are. President Toda was arrested for his beliefs and placed in prison, where he underwent a profound awakening to the ultimate truth of the Lotus Sutra. Even behind bars, he told the prison guards about the greatness of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to pray wholeheartedly to the Gohonzon to share Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s teachings with others. When you do so, people who are seeking Buddhism will appear in your environment. It\u2019s also crucial that you speak with whomever you can about the practice. Of course, there is no guarantee that any of them will take faith right away. But what matters is that you continue to steadily deepen your bonds of friendship with them, praying every day for their happiness while continuing to engage them in dialogue. If you plant seeds and nurture them with care, they will definitely bloom one day and bear fruit. There\u2019s no need to be impatient.\n\nIn addition, even if your friends haven\u2019t joined the Soka Gakkai, you can still bring them to meetings and study and chant together with them. It\u2019s important to let things happen naturally.\n\nAt any rate, all your efforts to share Nichiren Buddhism will come back to you as good fortune. Whether or not the other person starts to practice, you are still creating causes for your own attainment of Buddhahood.\n\nAnd when someone you\u2019ve been trying to introduce to the practice does decide to become a member, it is truly the most wonderful, joyous feeling.\n\nThe act of spreading the Daishonin\u2019s teachings\u2014of striving to help each person change their life on a fundamental level\u2014is an act of supreme good that guarantees a future of eternal happiness. It is an act of compassion millions of times greater than any other act of charity or philanthropy.\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 13, \u201cGuiding Star\u201d chapter.\n*\nThe distinguishing characteristic of Nichiren Buddhism is its ultimate goal of worldwide kosen-rufu and its emphasis on practicing toward that end. That is why Nichiren Daishonin established \u201cpracticing for oneself and practicing for others\u201d\u2014in other words, chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo oneself and teaching others to do the same\u2014as the two essential pillars of Buddhist practice.\n\nWhy does Nichiren Daishonin place so much importance on propagation? It is because the great path for each practitioner to attain enlightenment in this lifetime lies in actively striving to spread Buddhism with the same vow for kosen-rufu as Nichiren Daishonin himself.\n\nThe Daishonin writes: \u201cIf you are of the same mind as Nichiren, you must be a Bodhisattva of the Earth\u201d (WND-1, 385), and \u201cOne who recites even one word or phrase of the Lotus Sutra and who speaks about it to another person is the emissary of Shakyamuni Buddha, lord of the teachings\u201d (WND-1, 331).\n\nThese passages are clear declarations that those who take kosen-rufu\u2014Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s cherished wish\u2014as their mission, and who spread the correct teaching, are Bodhisattvas of the Earth*1 and emissaries of the Buddha. It is by carrying out our practice toward that end that our lives become attuned with the Daishonin\u2019s and that we manifest the life states of bodhisattva and Buddhahood. Consequently, pure, strong life force and boundless wisdom well forth from within. In this way, we can transform our lives, opening the path toward our human revolution, a fundamental transformation in our inner state of being.\n\nWhen our lives change on a profound level, we can overcome suffering that comes from illness, financial hardship, family discord, and so on, in accord with the Buddhist principles of the \u201coneness of body and mind\u201d and the \u201coneness of life and its environment.\u201d As a result, we can change our karma or destiny.\n\nThe Soka Gakkai has always advanced with unwavering commitment to kosen-rufu exactly as the Daishonin teaches. On the day that Josei Toda was inaugurated as the second president of the Soka Gakkai [on May 3, 1951], he boldly declared that he would dedicate the rest of his life to achieving a membership of 750,000 households. His reason for setting such a monumental goal was to lead the way for all Soka Gakkai members to attain a life state of absolute happiness. Shin\u2019ichi responded to this call, standing up alongside Toda with a firm resolve to make his mentor\u2019s vision a reality. Subsequently, other youth, countless comrades in faith, followed his lead.\n\nThe flame of courage burned brightly in the members\u2019 hearts, and an unshakable conviction that they would definitely become happy gradually took root.\n\nThough faced with various problems, they refused to be defeated, brimming with joy and pride of spreading the Mystic Law as Bodhisattvas of the Earth and emissaries of the Buddha. They were more troubled by the sufferings of their friends than their own illnesses or financial woes. Concerned about the future of their country and society at large, they prayed wholeheartedly for world peace.\n\nIn their innermost hearts, they had already attained a vast state of life that allowed them to take all personal problems and hardships in stride. This fundamental transformation dramatically changed the reality of their daily lives and brought them great benefit and happiness.\n\nTo dedicate our lives to the vow for kosen-rufu together with our mentor\u2014this is the direct path for achieving our own human revolution and changing our karma, a path that leads to absolute happiness.\n\nTaking part in this noble endeavor of kosen-rufu could be called our unique privilege and honor as Soka Gakkai members.\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 13,\u201cGuiding Star\u201d chapter.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Bodhisattvas of the Earth: An innumerable host of bodhisattvas who emerge from beneath the earth and to whom Shakyamuni Buddha entrusts the propagation of the Mystic Law, or the essence of the Lotus Sutra, in the Latter Day of the Law.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.7]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.9]"}, {"title": "chapter-18-9.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.9]\n18.9 Sharing Buddhism Just as You Are\nPresident Ikeda responds to young members\u2019 questions about Buddhist dialogue.\n\n[In response to a question about how to share Nichiren Buddhism with close friends]\n\nJust do what comes naturally. We have to keep in mind, however, that there is an appropriate time for everything. If you were to sit down to a formal dinner, for example, and immediately be served the main course, you might be a little surprised, since it\u2019s usually customary to serve an appetizer or salad first. When you visit someone\u2019s home, you don\u2019t just barge into the house. You wait until the host opens the door and invites you in.\n\nSimilarly, if you wish to talk with someone about Buddhism, there is a proper way to go about it. To friends, you might say something like: \u201cI practice Buddhism. It\u2019s a profound philosophy that teaches us many important things, such as the nature of life and the universe. Through Buddhism, you can come to understand things not taught in school, things that are more fundamental and profound. It is a philosophy that has deep value and significance for our lives. Would you like to talk about this life philosophy or Buddhism sometime? Or would you like to read about it?\u201d Even if they say they\u2019re not interested, through you, they have made a connection to Nichiren Buddhism and will surely come across it again. We should use the same natural approach when encouraging our fellow members.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to be impatient. Faith is a lifelong process, and indeed a journey continuing eternally throughout the three existences of past, present, and future. What\u2019s important is to make many friends and work at solidifying those relationships. Introducing others to Buddhism and striving for kosen-rufu are extensions of the spirit of friendship, of the wish to see those we care about become happy.\n*\n[In response to young members who felt they couldn\u2019t share Buddhism with others until their own present situations or circumstances had improved, because they didn\u2019t want to give a negative impression of the Soka Gakkai]\n\nThat\u2019s entirely up to you. As you seem to recognize, it\u2019s important to show actual proof of faith in one\u2019s daily life. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you should pretend to be something that you\u2019re not. It\u2019s perfectly fine for you to speak about Buddhism from the heart, in your own words, in a very natural way, just as you are. The purpose of faith is not to make yourself look good in the eyes of others. To have compassion for others means sincerely praying and working for others\u2019 happiness, no matter how they may regard you. They may not appreciate your sincerity at the time, but if you are genuine in your efforts, at some point they are bound to recall the friend who once encouraged them or helped them through a difficult time.

How should we respond to people who say, \u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying, but I do not want to join\u201d?]\n\nPrayer is the key. The important thing is to pray to the Gohonzon with steadfast determination. There is nothing more powerful than prayer.\n\nThis is not mere theory. Without prayer, all our efforts will ultimately get us nowhere. But when we wholeheartedly pray and talk to people, things will definitely begin to change.\n\nAlso, everyone\u2019s timing is different. The time will someday come for that person to awaken to the correct teaching of Buddhism. If we pray for them, it will definitely happen.\n\nWe must not be impatient. Please show patience and forbearance. Patience is essential for victory.\n\nAnd when people don\u2019t respond the way we hope, aren\u2019t they giving us a wonderful opportunity to chant lots of daimoku?!\n\nThe benefit is ours to enjoy. No effort that we make for kosen-rufu is ever wasted.

Therefore, it\u2019s important that you are genuine and openhearted, speaking in an easy-to-understand way.\n\nTalk to them confidently about the greatness of Buddhism and faith. Tell them about living a life of conviction. Explain to them how you have forged a life of value while enjoying proof of the power of your Buddhist practice and how you are advancing with courage and boundless hope for the future.\n\nUltimately, it all comes down to you proudly sharing your conviction and experience in faith. Doing so plants the seeds of happiness and hope in your friends\u2019 lives. These seeds will undoubtedly take root, bud, and eventually flower.

The passion and power of young people who uphold this priceless philosophy will create a new age.\n\nWhy is it important for youth to study the teachings of Nichiren Buddhism? There are numerous reasons, but I think they can be summed up in the following three points.\n\nFirst, Buddhist study helps us deepen our faith.\n\nI will never forget President Toda speaking with intense regret about the fact that a majority of the Soka Gakkai\u2019s members abandoned their faith when faced with oppression by the Japanese militarist authorities during World War II. \u201cNot having a solid grounding in Buddhist study,\u201d he said, \u201cthey failed to grasp the essence of Nichiren Buddhism. They grew fainthearted and were defeated by persecution. It\u2019s truly regrettable. A mistake I won\u2019t let happen again.\u201d\n\nBuddhist study is a beacon illuminating the path of faith. Even the complex workings of negative forces that arise to assail us are clearly revealed for what they are in the bright mirror of the Buddhist teachings.\n\nIndeed, studying the principles of Buddhism enables us to build our own solid foundation of faith and becomes a power source for our human revolution. For that reason, when Mr. Toda set about rebuilding the Soka Gakkai based on Buddhist study, he began by giving a series of lectures on the Lotus Sutra.\n\nSecond, Buddhist study serves as a driving force for kosen-rufu.\n\nThe Daishonin\u2019s writings present the correct teaching of Nichiren Buddhism and the path of propagation based on \u201crefuting the erroneous and revealing the true.\u201d They also fully describe the attitude in faith essential to realizing kosen-rufu, as well as the way to conduct oneself as a Buddhist leader and the key elements in fostering capable individuals.\n\nTo study the writings of Nichiren Daishonin is to come into contact with his spirit; it is to receive powerful encouragement directly from the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law, as well as guidelines for the promotion of kosen-rufu.\n\nWe can only be said to have truly studied Nichiren Buddhism when we take action in accord with the Daishonin\u2019s writings. There is no genuine Buddhist study without practice. And when we put the teachings into practice, limitless courage wells forth in our lives and we can display boundless ability and strength.\n\nThird, Buddhist study lays the foundation for establishing a new humanism.\n\nOur times are rife with serious challenges, including the threat of nuclear war, ethnic conflict, environmental problems, failing education systems, and other social issues. Though people long for happiness and world peace, things just grow more chaotic and confused. This results from the lack of a sound life philosophy.\n\nI believe the teachings of Buddhism alone can shine a light on these problems. Only by grounding ourselves in such Buddhist principles as respect and compassion for life, the oneness of body and mind, and the oneness of living beings and their environment can we open the way to a new humanism. Mr. Toda\u2019s Declaration Calling for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons was also an expression of the life-affirming principles of Buddhism.\n\nIt was Mr. Toda\u2019s conviction that there can be no bright future for humanity unless the youth division members who will shoulder responsibility for the 21st century gain a deep understanding of the philosophy of Nichiren Buddhism, the world\u2019s supreme teaching that can enable all humanity to attain happiness. He was confident that young people who embraced this great philosophy would go on to become world leaders in every field of human endeavor.\n\nMr. Toda always approached the study of Buddhism with the kind of intensity and rigor with which a master swordsman practices his art. On one occasion, he had gone to Osaka to give a lecture. He felt so ill, however, that he instructed a study department leader to get ready to take his place. But when the evening of the lecture arrived, he rose from his bed and announced:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give the lecture after all. The \u2018Life Span\u2019 chapter of the Lotus Sutra states: \u2018This, a Buddha\u2019s work, I have never for a moment neglected\u2019 (LSOC16, 267). The Buddha never rests in his efforts to alleviate the sufferings of the people. I\u2019ve traveled all the way here to give this lecture\u2014I can\u2019t just ask someone to take my place. Even if I die giving it, I\u2019ll have no regrets.\u201d\n\nMy mentor\u2019s death-defying determination taught me just how solemn is the responsibility of transmitting the teachings of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nIn my youth, I studied the Daishonin\u2019s writings thoroughly, to the extent that I actually committed many of his major writings to memory. That effort has built a foundation that has stood me well for my entire life.\n\nFrom an essay series \u201cThoughts on The New Human Revolution,\u201d published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, August 19, 1998.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 18: Buddhism Is a Teaching of Dialogue [18.10]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.2]"}, {"title": "chapter-19-2.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.2]\n19.2 Buddhist Study to Deepen Understanding Based on Faith\nReferring to President Toda\u2019s insight that one can either focus on an academic approach to studying Nichiren Buddhism or strive to deepen understanding of the teachings based on faith, President Ikeda stresses the importance of reading the Daishonin\u2019s writings within the context of our own lives and engraving their lessons in our innermost beings.\n\nTo open the writings of Nichiren Daishonin each day, to read them and study them\u2014this is the way for us to always live and strive together with the Daishonin, the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law.\n\nIn a letter to Nanjo Tokimitsu\u2019s mother\u2014the lay nun Ueno, who was left to raise her children on her own after her husband\u2019s untimely death\u2014the Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cNeither the pure land nor hell exists outside oneself; both lie only within one\u2019s own heart. Awakened to this, one is called a Buddha; deluded about it, one is called an ordinary person. The Lotus Sutra reveals this truth, and one who embraces the Lotus Sutra will realize that hell is itself the Land of Tranquil Light.*1\u201d (WND-1, 456)\n\nOne of the truly great things about the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism is that it presents life\u2019s most profound principles in clear and simple terms.\n\nNo matter what hellish suffering we may be experiencing, we can still bring forth the life state of Buddhahood from within us. When we resolutely chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we are able to create a \u201cCapital of Tranquil Light\u201d\u2014a realm pervaded with Buddhahood\u2014right where we are, in the midst of the reality in which we presently find ourselves. Each of us without exception can develop an eternal and indestructible state of happiness for ourselves and help others do the same.\n\nThat is the purpose of faith and also Buddhist study.\n*\nThrough the example of Shakyamuni\u2019s disciples Chudapanthaka and Devadatta, the Daishonin offers a solemn warning:\n\n\u201cChudapanthaka was unable to memorize a teaching of fourteen characters even in the space of three years, and yet he attained Buddhahood. Devadatta, on the other hand, had committed to memory sixty thousand teachings but fell into the hell of incessant suffering.\u201d (WND-1, 602)\n\nChudapanthaka, who was regarded as slow-witted, persevered with sincere devotion as a disciple of the Buddha and ultimately attained enlightenment, whereas Devadatta, who was acquainted with a vast number of Shakyamuni\u2019s teachings, eventually betrayed the Buddha and fell into the hell of incessant suffering.\n\nIn other words, just because one is good at Buddhist study doesn\u2019t make one superior or special. After all, being knowledgeable about Buddhism is no different from being knowledgeable about any other subject and is not the same as having faith. Unfortunately, there have in the past been foolish and arrogant leaders in the Soka Gakkai who, though making a great display of their knowledge of Buddhist doctrine, ended up discarding their faith and turning against the organization and their fellow members.\n\nAs practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism, our ultimate goals are attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime and realizing kosen-rufu. The only way to achieve those goals is to employ the \u201cstrategy of the Lotus Sutra\u201d (WND-1, 1001) and navigate our way through the stormy seas of life with an unwavering commitment to faith.\n\nThe purpose of Buddhist study is so that we can develop into truly exemplary practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism, courageous champions of faith and practice. We must never err on this point.\n\nMr. Toda said that there are two kinds of Buddhist study\u2014one that focuses on an academic approach and the other in which we strive to deepen our understanding of the teachings through faith. United together in spirit as mentor and disciple, Mr. Toda and I based all our activities for kosen-rufu on the latter kind. This is why the Soka Gakkai has triumphed. Through studying the Daishonin\u2019s teachings while actively putting them into action, our members have achieved one brilliant victory after another.\n*\nIn the Daishonin\u2019s writings, we can find boundless hope, courage, and promise. They help us bring forth our inner wisdom for winning in life, deepen our conviction in the power of the Mystic Law, and ignite our fighting spirit. Applying the Daishonin\u2019s writings to our daily lives\u2014\u201creading\u201d them with our lives\u2014enables us to wield the \u201csharp sword\u201d of faith that can cut through all obstacles and make the impossible possible.\n\nAt the kickoff for the Osaka Campaign*2 of 1956\u2014which led to achieving the seemingly impossible\u2014the Kansai members and I read the following passage from the Daishonin\u2019s writings together:\n\n\u201cI am praying that, no matter how troubled the times may become, the Lotus Sutra and the ten demon daughters*3 [guardian deities of Buddhism] will protect all of you, praying as earnestly as though to produce fire from damp wood, or to obtain water from parched ground.\u201d (WND-1, 444)\n\nEngraving these golden words in our lives, we embarked on our propagation campaign amid turbulent times with strong faith and confident prayer.\n\nTo encourage members who were struggling with work or financial hardship, I would share the Daishonin\u2019s words: \u201cThose who believe in the Lotus Sutra are as if in winter, but winter always turns to spring\u201d (WND-1, 536). I assured them that, even though it might seem that their lives were in the dead of winter, a wonderful springtime was certain to arrive as long as they remained steadfast in their Buddhist practice.\n\nBy sharing passages that spoke to the members\u2019 individual situations and circumstances, I tried to convey to them the importance of putting Buddhist study into practice. Their passionate seeking spirit in faith and our engaged study of the Daishonin\u2019s teachings based on the shared commitment of mentor and disciple opened the way to victory.\n\nWe also held study examinations that year. Their aim was not to check knowledge, but to enable each person to become happy and victorious in life and help them develop into outstanding champions of kosen-rufu.\n\nReferring to the Chinese characters that comprise the text of the Lotus Sutra, the Daishonin writes:\n\n\u201cTo the eyes of ordinary people, they look like characters. Persons of the two vehicles [i.e., voice-hearers and cause-awakened ones] perceive them as the void. Bodhisattvas look on them as innumerable doctrines. Buddhas recognize each character as a golden Shakyamuni. This is what is meant by the passage that says, \u2018[If one can uphold this sutra], one will be upholding the Buddha\u2019s body\u2019 [LSOC11, 220].\u201d (WND-1, 486)\n\nSimilarly, the words of a passage in the Daishonin\u2019s writings can take on a different depth of meaning depending on our life state or mind-set.\n\nThose who engage in Buddhist study with the firm resolve to always base their efforts in any endeavor on the Daishonin\u2019s writings can bring forth limitless power.\n\nFrom an essay series \u201cOur Brilliant Path to Victory,\u201d published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, September 10, 2011.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Land of Tranquil Light: Also, Land of Eternally Tranquil Light. The Buddha land, which is free from impermanence and impurity. In many sutras, the actual saha world in which human beings dwell is described as an impure land filled with delusions and sufferings, while the Buddha land is described as a pure land free from these and far removed from this saha world. In contrast, the Lotus Sutra reveals the saha world to be the Buddha land, or the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light, and explains that the nature of a land is determined by the minds of its inhabitants.\n*2Osaka Campaign: In May 1956, the Kansai members, uniting around a young Daisaku Ikeda, who had been dispatched by second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda to support them, introduced 11,111 households to the practice of the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism. In elections held two months later, the Soka Gakkai\u2013backed candidate in Kansai won a seat in the Upper House, an accomplishment that was thought all but impossible at the time.\n*3Ten demon daughters: The ten female protective deities who appear in the \u201cDharani\u201d (26th) chapter of the Lotus Sutra as the \u201cdaughters of rakshasa demons\u201d or the \u201cten rakshasa daughters.\u201d They vow to the Buddha to guard and protect the sutra\u2019s practitioners.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.1]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.3]"}, {"title": "chapter-19-3.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.3]\n19.3 A Shared Tradition of Studying the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin\nIn a discussion with youth division representatives, President Ikeda shares memories of studying the Daishonin\u2019s writings with President Toda and talks about the importance of Buddhist study and the attitude with which to approach it.\n\nPresident Toda often used to say that when studying the Daishonin\u2019s writings, rather than focusing on the meaning of the words, we should strive to connect with the Daishonin\u2019s towering conviction, his solemn, fervent commitment to kosen-rufu, and his boundless compassion in seeking to lead all people to enlightenment.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to just read the Daishonin\u2019s writings a little bit at a time. It doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t understand everything at first. What matters is to keep trying to read the Daishonin\u2019s writings and steadily engraving them in your life. Over time, as you repeat that process, you will create a solid core of philosophy in your life. Those who possess such an inner core will not be shaken by life\u2019s never-ending changes.\n\nThe ultimate aim of our Buddhist study is to become happy. We practice Nichiren Buddhism not only for our own happiness but to help others become happy, too.\n*\n[On hearing that youth division members had studied hard for a recently held study exam]\n\nTo be studying the great principles of Nichiren Buddhism is truly admirable. Those who read the Daishonin\u2019s writings every day, even just a little at a time, are able to tap fresh inspiration that will keep their faith healthy and sound.\n\nThe Daishonin\u2019s writings are incredibly profound. Each reading brings new discoveries and rouses fresh determinations.\n\nI studied earnestly under the tutelage of Mr. Toda. He trained me thoroughly.\n\nI will never forget the time back in November 1950, when Mr. Toda resigned as general director of the Soka Gakkai to prevent his business troubles from affecting the organization. Many people distanced themselves from him and, in a complete about-face, began criticizing and attacking him. He remained unperturbed, however, and looked calmly toward the future. It was around that time that he began giving lectures for me every morning on the Daishonin\u2019s writings and on a wide variety of other subjects.\n\nOur one-to-one study sessions started just after 8:00 a.m. and lasted about an hour. Mr. Toda was incredibly demanding. He gave his all, and I did my best to keep up. Apart from some unavoidable postponements along the way, Mr. Toda maintained this schedule of instruction for close to a decade, until just before his death. It was this strict yet compassionate training from my mentor that made me the person I am today. It is the foundation on which my life has been built.\n\nThe first of the Daishonin\u2019s works we studied was \u201cOn Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land,\u201d and then we went on to study the rest of his five major writings, \u201cThe Opening of the Eyes,\u201d \u201cOn Repaying Debts of Gratitude,\u201d \u201cThe Selection of the Time,\u201d and \u201cThe Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind.\u201d Next, we turned to \u201cThe Entity of the Mystic Law,\u201d The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, \u201cThe Unanimous Declaration by the Buddhas of the Three Existences,\u201d and many other writings.\n\nMr. Toda\u2019s words always brimmed with great conviction in faith. He also explained the essence of the Daishonin\u2019s teachings in simple, accessible language.\n\nWhile we were studying \u201cOn Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land,\u201d he said humorously: \u201cThe Mystic Law is like a magic wand! It will produce whatever we pray for, and enable us to become happy without fail.\u201d\n\nBack in those days, being more familiar with Western philosophy from reading the works of writers like Montaigne and Bergson, I still found Buddhism somewhat hard to grasp. These words of Mr. Toda, however, changed that. I realized that, in the chaos and poverty of postwar Japan, everyone was searching for such a sure-fire philosophy. With this seemingly casual, lightly spoken remark, Mr. Toda impressed upon me that Buddhism is not abstract theory, but a practical philosophy for living in the real world.\n\nI recall another occasion, about a month after Mr. Toda had resigned as general director. I was accompanying him to Ito [in Shizuoka Prefecture] on the Shonan train line. On the way, he gave me a private lecture on \u201cThe Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind,\u201d and as we gazed out at the ocean from the window, he said: \u201cUnless you read the Daishonin\u2019s writings with a life state of faith as vast and expansive as the Pacific, you won\u2019t be able to truly grasp his spirit and intent. It would be making a grave error to try to understand his writings with intellect alone.\u201d\n\nAt a time of great personal adversity, Mr. Toda studied the Daishonin\u2019s writings deeply.\n\nOur Buddhist study mustn\u2019t simply be an intellectual pursuit. Engaging in Buddhist study based on faith leads to deepening our conviction and inspiring us to action. This is the way of genuine practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism.\n*\nThe world and the times are constantly changing. Nothing ever stays the same. How can we perceive the true nature of things amid such ceaseless change?\n\nThe Daishonin writes: \u201cWhen one knows the Lotus Sutra, one understands the meaning of all worldly affairs\u201d (WND-1, 376). The teachings of Buddhism contain the wisdom for correctly perceiving all phenomena, providing a solid understanding of the world and of humanity, a correct understanding of society, and a universal understanding of the times.\n\nAccordingly, people who view the world from the perspective of Buddhism are strong: nothing can shake them. This is also why studying the Daishonin\u2019s writings is so important.\n*\n\u201cWhat defines a practitioner?\u201d\u2014President Makiguchi wrote these words firmly in the margin of his personal copy of the Daishonin\u2019s writings. On the same page, he had underlined in red a passage from \u201cThe Opening of the Eyes\u201d: \u201cIf there exists a votary [or practitioner] of the Lotus Sutra, then the three types of enemies are bound to exist as well\u201d (WND-1, 278).\n\nAs practice progresses, devilish functions arise. They invariably assail those who genuinely uphold the Buddha\u2019s teachings. Battling those devilish functions is what defines a votary, or practitioner, of the Lotus Sutra, and also a Buddha. Mr. Makiguchi grasped this core truth of Buddhism. For this reason, when devilish functions took root within the priesthood, he recognized them for what they were and fought resolutely against them.\n\nFurther, during his some 500 days of imprisonment for his beliefs, he declared serenely that everything was unfolding exactly in accord with the Daishonin\u2019s writings.\n\nWe study the teachings of Nichiren Buddhism in order to be able to discern the workings of the devilish functions. In that sense, Buddhist study is a \u201csword\u201d with which we can battle negative functions.\n\nWhile in prison, Mr. Makiguchi read the Daishonin\u2019s writings with his very life. In doing so, he provided the Soka Gakkai with a model for the eternal future.\n\nHe marked the words \u201cHere I will make a great vow\u201d (WND-1, 280) from \u201cThe Opening of the Eyes\u201d with a double underline, and beside them inscribed in large characters the words, \u201cGreat Vow.\u201d\n\nBecause he died in prison, it might be thought that Mr. Makiguchi\u2019s life ended in tragedy, but today countless people around the world are unstinting in their praise for his life and his commitment to that \u201cgreat vow.\u201d\n\nLet us continue to forge ahead boldly on our path of eternal honor based on the Daishonin\u2019s writings and carrying on the Daishonin\u2019s spirit, just like Mr. Makiguchi did.\n\nFrom a dialogue series \u201cConversations with Youth,\u201d published in Japanese in the Daibyakurenge, 1994.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.2]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.4]"}, {"title": "chapter-19-4.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.4]\n19.4 \u201cExert Yourself in the Two Ways of Practice and Study\u201d\nPresident Ikeda discusses the proud Soka Gakkai tradition of striving in the \u201ctwo ways of practice and study\u201d as taught by Nichiren Daishonin.\n\nThe copy of the Gosho, the writings of Nichiren Daishonin, that first Soka Gakkai president Tsunesaburo Makiguchi always carried with him survives to this day, and I value it as one of the Soka Gakkai\u2019s greatest treasures.\n\nMr. Makiguchi heavily underlined the following passage, drawing a double circle in the margin next to it:\n\n\u201cExert yourself in the two ways of practice and study. Without practice and study, there can be no Buddhism. You must not only persevere yourself; you must also teach others.\u201d (WND-1, 386)\n\nIn complete accord with these words from \u201cThe True Aspect of All Phenomena,\u201d Mr. Makiguchi persevered in the two ways of practice and study to the very end. Bravely facing the onslaughts of the three obstacles and four devils,*1 he continued to put the Daishonin\u2019s writings into practice in his life, even after being imprisoned for his beliefs. His behavior was in stark contrast with that of the cowardly Nichiren Shoshu priests, who deleted passages from the Daishonin\u2019s writings out of fear of persecution by the militarist authorities.\n\nEven under harsh interrogation, Mr. Makiguchi dauntlessly continued to proclaim the lofty spirit of \u201cestablishing the correct teaching for the peace of the land.\u201d Beyond that, he also engaged his prison guards in sincere discussions about Buddhism. And right up until his death in prison, he continued to explore the philosophies and ideas of the world\u2019s leading thinkers through the lens of Buddhism.\n\nOur commitment to the two ways of practice and study was thus established by the founder of the Soka Gakkai, an organization now advancing steadily forward as a new light of hope for the world. In this diligent pursuit of practice and study, we find the true essence of Buddhist action and the noblest way a person can live.\n\nIn \u201cThe True Aspect of All Phenomena,\u201d the Daishonin goes on to state: \u201cBoth practice and study arise from faith\u201d (WND-1, 386). When faith deepens, practice and study progress, and when practice and study progress, faith deepens. Through this chain of cause and effect, our lives become filled with benefit that can vanquish the negative and bring forth the positive; we are assured of true happiness and able to accumulate everlasting good fortune.\n\nNeglecting the two ways of practice and study is like flying an airplane with no idea of your direction, altitude, or destination, and no means of refueling. You will inevitably stray off course and lose speed. Faced with even the slightest turbulence, you will come crashing down. Those who persevere in the two ways of practice and study, however, walk the supreme path of victors in life; they are people who will never regress in faith and therefore always triumph.\n\nSuch things as popularity and celebrity are no more than empty illusions, but action is the hallmark of a person of true substance.\n\nOver the years, our women\u2019s division members, in particular, have braved criticism and abuse while persevering with courage and tenacity to share the Mystic Law\u2014the ultimate means for attaining happiness\u2014with one individual after another. Where in this world can we find anything more heroic and noble?\n\nOne such women\u2019s division member in the early days of our movement, who had been unable to attend school under the bitter conditions of World War II, later introduced a university professor to the practice of Nichiren Buddhism. When Mr. Toda learned of her achievement, he smiled broadly and heaped praise and congratulations on her. It is a scene that I and many of my fellow pioneering members will never forget.\n\nAll of the self-serving individuals who abandoned their faith and then turned on the Soka Gakkai have one thing in common: they failed to make persistent, serious efforts in the two ways of practice and study. They were complacent, arrogant, and conceited.\n\nIf you cease to exert yourself in practice and study, your life will stop moving toward absolute happiness. Such stagnation almost always gives rise to arrogance, laziness, and resentment toward others. Mr. Toda sternly warned that leaders who are lax in practice and study only confuse and sow doubt in the members\u2019 hearts.\n\nThe lectures I attended at what I fondly refer to as \u201cToda University\u201d included not only a diverse array of academic subjects but also sessions dedicated to the teachings of Nichiren Buddhism. For instance, Mr. Toda delivered profound and insightful lectures on the Daishonin\u2019s writing \u201cThe Entity of the Mystic Law.\u201d\n\nStudying with Mr. Toda was as rigorous as the training of a master swordsman. Once, when he had finished a series of lectures, he presented participants with a certificate of completion. It was a simple document, on a single sheet of paper, and some people made fun of it. But I regarded it as an honor of the highest distinction, and accepted it with an inner pledge to repay the profound debt of gratitude I owed him.\n\nI am confident that the almost 200 honorary degrees and titles I have now received from institutions around the world are the result of my vow at that time. This is actual proof derived from following the path of mentor and disciple, steadfastly upholding the \u201cLaw of the Lotus,\u201d which \u201cexplains the subtleties of cause and effect\u201d (cf. WND-1, 421).\n\nThe British historian Arnold J. Toynbee, whom I deeply admire, made it a practice to set himself to work every morning, even if he sometimes didn\u2019t feel like it, and to accomplish something of value every single day. He strictly observed this personal regimen all his life.\n\nRead the writings of Nichiren Daishonin every day, even if only a single sentence; talk to others about Buddhism every day, even if only a single word or phrase. When you exert yourself in your Buddhist practice by speaking out and taking action, a fresh and vibrant surge of life force will begin to flow within you in tune with the rhythm of the universe.\n\nI have persevered in the two ways of practice and study with unwavering determination to spread the Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin, our eternal mentor, and to fulfill the vow I made to President Toda, my mentor in life. That determination remains completely unchanged today, because I know that the bright path of mentor and disciple does not exist apart from the two ways of practice and study.\n\nFrom an editorial titled \u201cThe Two Ways of Practice and Study,\u201d published in Japanese in the Daibyakurenge, September 2006.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Three obstacles and four devils: Various obstacles and hindrances to the practice of Buddhism.

It is a universal and enduring philosophy beyond compare.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cExert yourself in the two ways of practice and study. Without practice and study, there can be no Buddhism. You must not only persevere yourself; you must also teach others. Both practice and study arise from faith\u201d (WND-1, 386). Without the two ways of practice and study, Buddhism would cease to exist, and no one could attain Buddhahood.\n\nI\u2019m sure some of you have traveled long distances today, and some of you may be quite tired. Yet in spite of that, you\u2019ve gathered here out of your determination to study Buddhism. All of your efforts will bring you benefit and are the way to accumulate immense good fortune. In lifetime after lifetime, you will be people who are admired as great philosophers who surpass even the most learned scholars.\n\nThe important thing is to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. Don\u2019t worry about whether or not you\u2019re able to answer all the exam questions: simply try your hardest and know that the efforts you have made to challenge yourself for the sake of kosen-rufu will become a source of eternal good fortune and remain as cherished memories in your lives.\n\nThe Daishonin, more than anyone, is surely praising you most highly for exerting yourselves in the two ways of practice and study.\n\nThe Daishonin alone awakened to the ultimate Law of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. None of the powerful or famous were aware of the correct teaching of Buddhism.\n\nThe Buddhist Law is the eternal principle that pervades the universe and all life. It is the key for building a happy life. Neither happiness nor peace will ever be attainable if we disparage or turn our backs on the correct teaching of Buddhism.\n\nOn the vast stage of human history, you are all noble pioneers in the great undertaking of spreading Nichiren Buddhism. Please take the exam with strong confidence in yourselves. The fact that you have gathered for this occasion to study Buddhism is itself a victory and an achievement. It will become a powerful driving force for your faith all your life.

So, even if you should pass the exam but let it go to your head and lord it over others, you will have failed in the realm of faith. On the other hand, if you do not pass, that can become an incentive for you to make greater efforts to study Buddhism and thereby come to excel as a person of faith, something far more important than simply passing the exam.\n\n\u201cIn addition, I hope you will engrave the writings of Nichiren Daishonin deeply in your hearts and develop strong, solid faith so that you will remain undaunted by any obstacle that might assail you.\u201d\n\nStudy exams were held on Sunday, March 5, at more than 180 sites in 125 cities nationwide. At 9:00 a.m., exams were held for Study Department assistant instructors who wished to advance to the next level of instructor, and instructors who wished to become assistant professors. Then at 2:00 p.m., the entrance exam was held for those seeking to become members of the Study Department for the first time.\n\nThat day, more than 110,000 people took these exams around the country. This was roughly 3.3 times the number who had taken the previous series of exams in 1959, less than two years earlier, a further demonstration of the phenomenal growth the Soka Gakkai had achieved since Shin\u2019ichi became its president.\n\nThose taking the exams ranged from homemakers to company presidents, from students to educators. They were of all ages, from teenagers to seniors. Making use of the little spare time they had with their work commitments or school studies, not to mention Soka Gakkai activities, all of them had earnestly studied the Daishonin\u2019s writings, striving to deepen their understanding of the profound teachings and philosophy of Nichiren Buddhism. There were even stories from around the country of individuals learning to read and write as a result of the efforts they made for the exam.\n\nThe creation of a new era and new society begins when people have a solid philosophy of life and a clear awareness of their personal mission. The Soka Gakkai\u2019s study program represented an unprecedented philosophical and educational movement centered on ordinary people.\n\nThat evening after the study exams, Shin\u2019ichi spoke with Study Department leader Chuhei Yamadaira at the Soka Gakkai Headquarters and inquired about the progress in grading test papers from around the country.\n\nWhen Yamadaira affirmed that everything was going smoothly, Shin\u2019ichi said in a low voice, as if to himself: \u201cThose who took the exams worked very hard. I\u2019d like to give them all a passing grade.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do that!\u201d exclaimed Yamadaira.\n\nShin\u2019ichi couldn\u2019t help grinning at the Study Department leader\u2019s emphatic response. He said: \u201cI know that, of course. It\u2019s an exam, after all; I was only voicing my personal sentiment.\n\n\u201cBut just think how difficult it is for, say, a women\u2019s division member who is busy as a mother and a homemaker. Simply doing Soka Gakkai activities is challenging enough, not to mention finding time to study the Daishonin\u2019s writings. With crying children, looking after the house as well as cooking, it\u2019s almost impossible for her to find time to study quietly even if she wants to. It\u2019s like trying to read the Gosho in the middle of a battlefield!\n\n\u201cGranted, such challenges may be part of our Buddhist practice, but I don\u2019t want such members to be discouraged and disheartened because of their exam results. Those who pass will be fine. My thoughts are constantly with those who don\u2019t pass and what we can do to encourage them.\u201d\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 4, \u201cSpring Storm\u201d chapter.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.5]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.7]"}, {"title": "chapter-19-7.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.7]\n19.7 Basing Our Lives on the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin\nPresident Ikeda describes how the Soka Gakkai has prevailed over adversity by remaining firmly based on Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s writings.\n\nA vibrant seeking spirit to strive energetically in the two ways of practice and study has spread across the globe. People everywhere are studying and putting into action the great humanistic teachings of Nichiren Buddhism. The Daishonin\u2019s vision is being realized by the Soka Gakkai, the organization faithfully carrying out the Buddha\u2019s intent.\n\nThe Soka Gakkai will forever base itself on the Gosho, the writings of Nichiren Daishonin. They are writings of hope, proclaiming to humanity that \u201cWinter always turns to spring\u201d (WND-1, 536). They are writings imbued with respect for the dignity of life, affirming that \u201cLife is the foremost of all treasures\u201d (WND-1, 1125). They are writings of peace, opening the way for actualizing the ideal of \u201cestablishing the correct teaching for the peace of the land\u201d (cf. WND-1, 6).\n\nAnd they are writings of victory, demonstrating the triumph of reason over authority and of right over wrong.*1\n\nNichiren Daishonin\u2019s writings are a brilliant source of hope; studying them fills us with courage and wisdom. This is because doing so brings his indomitable spirit to life within us, igniting the bright flame of faith for overcoming obstacles.\n\nMy wife, Kaneko, has an indelible memory from her childhood of President Makiguchi attending a discussion meeting at her home and quoting from the writings of Nichiren Daishonin with absolute conviction\u2014even as agents of the Special Higher Police, the so-called thought police who were monitoring the meeting, looked on. She also received direct training from President Toda who set forth the guideline \u201cYoung women, make study your foundation!\u201d That is why she has always continued to read the Gosho in earnest, whatever the situation.\n\nEven after becoming a women\u2019s division member, she used any spare moment she could find to read even a few lines of the Daishonin\u2019s writings. In the midst of the turmoil surrounding the Freedom of Speech Incident,*2 a newspaper reporter came to our home to interview me. He happened to see my wife quietly reading the Gosho, and later said how surprised he was that she should be engaged in Buddhist study even at such a difficult time.\n\nThat\u2019s how my wife has remained undefeated. It\u2019s why the women\u2019s division has stayed unshaken. Even in times of the greatest hardship, they have always remained calm and composed and continued to encourage members with a smile. Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and studying the Daishonin\u2019s writings are the sources of their victory.\n\nMr. Toda spoke of the way to approach reading the Gosho, saying: \u201cAs you read each line, you should try to absorb it deeply, so that you can say \u2018How true! It\u2019s just as the Gosho states!\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to read the Daishonin\u2019s writings each day, even if only a few lines, and try to put them into practice. Please study earnestly, practice diligently, and create a brilliant example of winning in life based on Buddhism.\n\nFrom a speech at a divisional representatives conference, Tokyo, December 26, 2008.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cBuddhism is reason. Reason will win over your lord\u201d (WND-1, 839); and \u201cThough evils may be numerous, they cannot prevail over a single great truth\u201d (WND-1, 618).\n*2Freedom of Speech Incident: The name given to a controversy that arose in 1970, when the Soka Gakkai defended itself against libelous claims.

What makes a person truly great? Not wealth, fame, or physical beauty. There are many cases where people enjoy fame for a time, but end up leading unhappy lives. True greatness is determined by the teachings we embrace, the philosophy we study, and the extent to which we put these into practice in our daily lives.\n\nAll of you who uphold the world\u2019s foremost life philosophy of Nichiren Buddhism are leading the most triumphant, meaningful lives, spending your youth in the most noble and fulfilling of ways.\n\nPerhaps it is natural for people to be drawn to bright lights and glamour. It is often thought that fame makes a person somehow special, and those with high social status are often regarded as great. But that is an illusion.\n\nEach of you is the most precious treasure of all. Happiness does not exist outside of you. There is nothing more wonderful than you. This is what Buddhism teaches. It enables you to bring your most precious treasure\u2014you yourself\u2014to shine. That is what makes it a genuine philosophy.\n\nPeople tend to compare themselves to others. Of course, it is important to try to learn from others\u2019 good traits. But it\u2019s petty to envy what appears to be their happiness and good fortune. Nothing comes of that. Those who focus on polishing themselves and living with a sense of purpose are the winners in life. Please bear this point deeply in mind.\n\nThrough its teaching of the enlightenment of women, the Lotus Sutra embodies a life philosophy that can transform human history, opening the way for the equality, dignity, and happiness of all humanity. The Daishonin writes: \u201cThe enlightenment of women is expounded as a model [for the enlightenment of all living beings]\u201d (WND-1, 930), and \u201cAmong the teachings of the Lotus Sutra, that of women attaining Buddhahood is first\u201d (WND-1, 930).\n\nThe earnest prayers and unflagging efforts of your noble predecessors have ushered in an age of women. The stage for your activities now extends throughout the world.\n\nIn the Daishonin\u2019s treatise \u201cThe True Aspect of All Phenomena,\u201d we find the important passage:\n\n\u201cExert yourself in the two ways of practice and study. Without practice and study, there can be no Buddhism. You must not only persevere yourself; you must also teach others. Both practice and study arise from faith. Teach others to the best of your ability, even if it is only a single sentence or phrase.\u201d (WND-1, 386)\n\nI hope you will all experience for yourselves, and demonstrate to others, just how sublime is a youth spent exerting oneself in the two ways of practice and study.\n\nThe Daishonin also writes:\n\n\u201cOthers read the Lotus Sutra with their mouths alone, in word alone, but they do not read it with their hearts. And even if they read it with their hearts, they do not read it with their actions. It is reading the sutra with both one\u2019s body and mind [as you have by encountering this hardship] that is truly praiseworthy!\u201d (WND-1, 204)\n\nEncountering life-threatening persecution as a result of speaking out to proclaim and defend the correct teaching in exact accord with the Daishonin\u2019s spirit, and battling dauntlessly against all manner of obstacles\u2014this is the proud history of our Soka movement based on the mentor-disciple relationship. I hope that you, our young women\u2019s division members, will continue along this honorable path.\n\n\u201cYoung women, make study your foundation!\u201d\u2014this is an eternal guideline set forth by President Toda. Nichiren Buddhism is the ultimate philosophy of happiness and peace. Through its wisdom, we can transform our lives on a fundamental level, bring people together, and change the destiny of the world.\n\nMr. Toda observed: \u201cNo matter how much humanity may come to understand the physical world, it won\u2019t lead to inner happiness.\u201d He also said: \u201cThe Daishonin sought to find a way to enable all people to attain happiness. When we earnestly study and put into practice the life philosophy of Nichiren Buddhism, it will shine as the ultimate teaching for becoming absolutely happy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of the importance of philosophy, Mr. Toda declared:\n\n\u201cWhy do we need philosophy? Why do our lives need the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism? If it were enough to just do as we pleased, there\u2019d be no need to go to school and study or have religious faith. But if we follow that course, we\u2019ll only come to regret it later. On the other hand, by studying philosophy, by studying Buddhism, we gain access to the most profound depths of life. What incredible joy there is to be found in seeking and attaining\u2014with an open heart and deep emotion and inspiration\u2014true and lasting happiness! What an immeasurable delight it is to know the deeply wondrous nature of life and experience our own beings brimming with limitless joy!\u201d\n\nHe further stated:\n\n\u201cWith the Gohonzon as our foundation, we of the Soka Gakkai are advancing toward the lofty goal of kosen-rufu. And we are carrying out our practice based on studying the teachings of the world\u2019s greatest life philosophy, the quintessence of all Buddhist teachings.\u201d\n\nThe karmic ties we share as fellow members, working together for kosen-rufu with the Soka Gakkai, are profound indeed.\n\nMr. Toda also made the following remarks to the young women\u2019s division:\n\n\u201cClosely examining human existence, Nichiren Buddhism solidly brings together the four viewpoints of self, life, society, and the universe.\u201d\n*\n\u201cRead the Daishonin\u2019s writings more intently. Everything you need is written there.\u201d\n*\n\u201cIf you make the Daishonin\u2019s writings your foundation, you will never be swayed by any problem.\u201d\n*\n\u201cIf you base yourself on the supreme value of the Mystic Law, you\u2019ll always know how to proceed.\u201d\n\nIf we look at things from the perspective of faith, the way forward will become clear to us. Do not be deceived by pretense or hypocrisy. The time of youth is one when we are easily swayed by our emotions and environment. Establishing an unshakable foundation of Buddhist study in your lives while you are still young, therefore, is profoundly meaningful.\n\nFrom a speech at a young women\u2019s division commemorative gathering, Tokyo, June 4, 2009.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.7]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.9]"}, {"title": "chapter-19-9.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.9]\n19.9 Study of Nichiren Buddhism Is the Driving Force for Human Revolution\nPresident Ikeda discusses the importance of reading the writings of Nichiren Daishonin and applying them to one\u2019s life, and explains why President Toda placed such importance on Buddhist study when he was rebuilding the Soka Gakkai after World War II.\n\nIn October 1271, shortly after the life-threatening Tatsunokuchi Persecution and just before departing for his exile on Sado Island,*1 Nichiren Daishonin sent a heartfelt letter to his disciples in which he wrote: \u201cOne may be letter-perfect in reciting the Lotus Sutra, but it is far more difficult to act as it teaches\u201d (WND-1, 200).\n\nHe then went on to declare that, in encountering great persecution by practicing exactly as the Buddha taught, he alone had \u201cread and lived\u201d the passages of the Lotus Sutra predicting that its practitioners of future ages would be \u201cdespised, hated, envied, and resented\u201d (cf. LSOC3, 110), and that \u201chatred and jealousy toward the sutra will abound even more after the Buddha\u2019s passing\u201d (cf. LSOC10, 203; cf. WND-1, 200).\n\nNo doubt the words of this indomitable lion king shook his beloved disciples to the core. He was asking: \u201cHow will you, my disciples, fight when you meet such trials or obstacles?\u201d\n\nThe writings of Nichiren Daishonin are timeless scriptures. They are a stirring cry from his very being. They are an impassioned declaration of truth and justice, which he left for us who practice the Lotus Sutra in the Latter Day, an evil age rife with devilish functions. They are a mighty lion\u2019s roar calling out to us powerfully: \u201cStrive with courage and never abandon your faith!\u201d \u201cAdorn your lives with triumph!\u201d \u201cResolutely defeat evil!\u201d\n\nThat is why all of us, as the Daishonin\u2019s disciples, must seriously ask ourselves whenever we read his writings: \u201cHow will I live my life? How will I challenge myself for kosen-rufu?\u201d\n\nTo read the Daishonin\u2019s writings with one\u2019s life means to read them not as something that concerns others or as an account of something that happened long ago, but as something that directly relates to us and the present, and to apply it to the challenges we face in our own lives. This is the correct path for manifesting the solemn spirit of oneness of mentor and disciple.\n\nIt is important that we deeply impress the Daishonin\u2019s words in our hearts\u2014even if it is just a single line or passage that strikes an inner chord or feels as if it were written especially for us\u2014and that we constantly make fresh efforts for the sake of kosen-rufu with unwavering faith. This is how we can observe the injunction of Nikko Shonin, the Daishonin\u2019s direct successor, which calls on us to \u201cengrave the Daishonin\u2019s writings in our lives\u201d (GZ, 1618).*2\n\nDuring World War II, Mr. Toda spent two dark years in prison as a result of persecution by the Japanese militarist government. It was while behind bars that he awakened to kosen-rufu as the ultimate mission of his life. As the disciple of first president Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, who tragically died in prison, he vowed not to be defeated by the repressive forces of authority who were to blame for his mentor\u2019s death. He was fearless; not even the prospect of execution by firing squad could deter him. Immediately upon his release from prison, he launched his great struggle for kosen-rufu.\n\nThis same persecution, however, had caused the rest of Mr. Makiguchi\u2019s disciples to abandon their faith. In \u201cThe Opening of the Eyes,\u201d the Daishonin writes: \u201cFoolish men are likely to forget the promises they have made when the crucial moment comes\u201d (WND-1, 283). At the crucial moment, these disciples trembled and cowered and discarded the precious sword that was their faith in the Mystic Law. Mr. Toda lamented and grieved at this turn of events. Why would mere imprisonment cause them to abandon their faith? Wasn\u2019t it the most brilliant opportunity to acquire great and everlasting benefit? After all, there is nothing timid or fainthearted about the faith that the Daishonin describes in his writings.\n\nPresident Toda reflected. He contemplated the matter seriously. Day and night, this man of extraordinary intellect thought deeply, constantly asking himself why the others had given up faith.\n\nHe came to the conclusion that they lacked a foundation in Buddhist study, which clarifies what faith is all about and serves as the driving force for one\u2019s practice. He realized that he had forgotten to teach them to read the Daishonin\u2019s writings. If he enabled members to imbue their lives with Buddhist study\u2014that is, with the teachings contained in the Daishonin\u2019s writings\u2014they would not quit practicing. Even the timid would be inspired to persevere in their struggles with courage. The Daishonin\u2019s writings\u2014that is the key, he realized.\n\nBased on Mr. Toda\u2019s guidance to this effect, which sprang from the painful lessons of his wartime experience, the Soka Gakkai as a whole\u2014leaders and members alike\u2014carried the Daishonin\u2019s writings with them everywhere and studied them thoroughly.\n\nThere is no Buddhism without study. And Buddhism without faith is not Buddhism.\n\nWhenever we had a spare moment [in those early days of our movement], we studied the Daishonin\u2019s writings. At every meeting, we read them, discussed them, and studied them together. A bright new flame burned within us. Our eyes sparkled with the vision of a vast new future. Reading the Daishonin\u2019s writings contributed directly to our human revolution; it was the impetus for limitlessly deepening our faith.\n\nThe Buddhist study I am referring to is not the study of abstract concepts. It is not about memorizing difficult doctrines or becoming a scholar or academic.\n\nThe study of the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism that we undertook at that time served as a source of strength to persevere in our lives, in our daily struggles, and in our efforts for kosen-rufu. It was a process of acquiring an understanding of the teachings and principles of Nichiren Buddhism, a great philosophy that we could actually make part of our lives in order to take on life\u2019s challenges and win in society.\n\nFrom an essay series \u201cThe Light of the Century of Humanity,\u201d published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, October 20, 2004.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Tatsunokuchi Persecution and Sado Exile: On September 12, 1271, the authorities arrested Nichiren Daishonin and took him to a place called Tatsunokuchi on the outskirts of Kamakura, where they tried to summarily execute him under cover of darkness. When the execution attempt failed, he was held in detention at the residence of the deputy constable of Sado, Homma Rokuro Saemon, in Echi (part of present-day Kanagawa Prefecture). After a period of about a month while the government debated what to do with him, he was exiled to Sado Island, which was tantamount to a death sentence. However, when his predictions of internal strife and foreign invasion were fulfilled, the government issued a pardon in March 1274, and he returned to Kamakura.\n*2Article 11 of \u201cThe Twenty-Six Admonitions of Nikko.\u201d Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s designated successor, Nikko Shonin, wrote the \u201cTwenty-Six Admonitions\u201d in 1333 for the sake of practitioners of future generations to maintain the purity of the Daishonin\u2019s teachings. It outlines the fundamental spirit of faith, practice, and study.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.8]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.10]"}, {"title": "chapter-19-10.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.10]\n19.10 The Power of Engraving the Daishonin\u2019s Words in Our Hearts\nThe following is a scene from The New Human Revolution, where the novel\u2019s protagonist Shin\u2019ichi Yamamoto (whose character represents President Ikeda) shares with a youth some words of Nichiren Daishonin that he has taken deeply to heart.\n\n\u201cThere is one passage of The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings,\u201d Shin\u2019ichi said, \u201cthat I have always taken deeply to heart since my days supporting and assisting Mr. Toda: \u2018If in a single moment of life we exhaust the pains and trials of millions of kalpas, then instant after instant there will arise in us the three Buddha bodies*1 with which we are eternally endowed. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is just such a \u201cdiligent\u201d practice\u2019 (OTT, 214).\u201d\n\nThis passage teaches the essence of attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime. \u201cThe three Buddha bodies with which we are eternally endowed\u201d refers to the boundless life state of Buddhahood within us. The key to manifesting this life state in each instant is to expend millions of kalpas\u2019 worth of strenuous effort in a single moment of life. \u201cMillions of kalpas\u201d means an infinite expanse of time. Through practicing Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism with this kind of concentrated effort, we can bring forth our inherent Buddha wisdom and life force.\n\nShin\u2019ichi continued: \u201cThe Daishonin teaches that only through intense struggle, undaunted by hardships, can we attain Buddhahood in this lifetime, carry out our human revolution, and transform our life condition. In a sense, my days have been a continuous, arduous, all-out struggle. I have been through inconceivably bitter experiences time and again.\n\n\u201cOn those occasions, this passage sustained me, helping me renew my resolve, chant daimoku, overcome all hardships, and emerge triumphant.\n\n\u201cIt is important that you courageously exert yourself, too, for the sake of kosen-rufu, the happiness of others, and your own future.\u201d\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 26, \u201cAtsuta\u201d chapter.\nSupplementary Reading\n\nThe writings of Nichiren Daishonin have been translated into more than 10 languages, making them available to people around the world. In his preface to the Spanish edition, published in 2008, President Ikeda emphasizes the importance of interfaith dialogue and clarifies the significance of deepening our understanding of the teachings of Nichiren Buddhism today.\n\nThe essential purpose of all religions is to impart hope and give meaning to our lives. All religions basically aim to provide inner serenity and contribute to happiness and peace. In that sense, they share the fundamental goal of benefitting people.\n\nI firmly believe that a profound recognition of this common ground is the requirement of religion in this age of globalization. It also serves as the foundation for interfaith dialogue, one of the pressing challenges facing human civilization.\n\nOf course, each religion is unique and different. For example, each offers different views on what constitutes genuine inner serenity\u2014ranging from experiencing the love of God to a feeling of reliance on an unseen higher power, following the dictates of one\u2019s conscience, possessing a state of inner peace or the ability to control one\u2019s desires, and numerous other variants. The differences among religions have arisen from a host of complex causes, including innate human diversity, factors linked to particular places and times, and historical background.\n\nBut all of these differing religious teachings contain, in some form, insights and truths for enabling human beings to attain happiness. By learning from those respective insights and truths, while recognizing their mutual differences, all religions can improve their capacity for fulfilling their essential role in guiding people to happiness.\n\nIt is my sincere hope that all the religions of the world will continue to follow this path of dialogue and mutual self-improvement and, while demonstrating their unique value, join together as religions dedicated to the welfare of humanity and become a major force for world peace.\n\nThe 20th century has been described as the first century in which the religions of the world started to acknowledge and communicate with one another. It is certainly true that the tragedies wrought by the two world wars provoked deep reflection, reawakening the awareness of the happiness and peace of humanity as the great purpose of religion, and creating a new current of mutual recognition among religions based upon that perspective. It is the mission of religion in the 21st century to amplify that current into a real and meaningful groundswell.\n\nThe Soka Gakkai was founded between the two world wars of the 20th century. Religious groups in Japan at that time had for the most part been subsumed within the Japanese state apparatus, employed to support and promote the state\u2019s policies and interests. As a result, they lacked either the moral courage or power to prevent the militarization of Japanese society and its slide toward war.\n\nIt was against such a backdrop that the Soka Gakkai rediscovered the potential of Nichiren Buddhism, and the Lotus Sutra upon which it is based, as a body of teachings for the happiness of all humanity, and began to put those teachings into practice. Because of this, the Soka Gakkai was subjected to harsh persecution by the Japanese militarist authorities of the day, and its founder, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, died in prison refusing to compromise his beliefs.\n\nAccording to the Lotus Sutra\u2014which is the essence of Mahayana Buddhism\u2014the wish of the Mahayana bodhisattvas to realize happiness for both self and others is the fundamental wish of all human beings, and, indeed, of all living beings. Awakening people to this fundamental wish and enabling them to bring forth their positive potential is, I believe, the essential mission not only of Buddhism, but of all religions.\n\nThe Lotus Sutra describes the emergence into the world of a great multitude of such bodhisattvas who embrace this essential mission\u2014the so-called Bodhisattvas of the Earth. It articulates the extremely important point that when awakened to this fundamental wish inherent in life, all people can become Bodhisattvas of the Earth.\n\nThe Lotus Sutra also teaches the shining example of Bodhisattva Never Disparaging, who greeted every person he met with the words, \u201cI have profound reverence for you\u201d (LSOC20, 308), and persisted in this practice of revering others even when insulted and physically attacked. He exemplifies the essence of the bodhisattva practice\u2014believing in our own Buddha nature and the Buddha nature of others and profoundly respecting all people.\n\nAccording to the Daishonin, Bodhisattva Never Disparaging\u2019s practice of demonstrating profound respect for people is the core practice of the Lotus Sutra and the heart of Buddhism itself. He clearly proclaims:\n\n\u201cThe heart of the Buddha\u2019s lifetime of teachings is the Lotus Sutra, and the heart of the practice of the Lotus Sutra is found in the \u201c[Bodhisattva] Never Disparaging\u201d chapter. What does Bodhisattva Never Disparaging\u2019s profound respect for people signify? The purpose of the appearance in this world of Shakyamuni Buddha, the lord of teachings, lies in his behavior as a human being.\u201d (WND-1, 851\u201352)\n\nBorn in 13th-century Japan, the Daishonin keenly perceived that he was living in an age when people were steadily losing sight of the Buddha\u2019s great vow to lead all people to enlightenment\u2014the expression of our highest potential. When this happens, people succumb to egoism. The three poisons of greed, anger, and foolishness pollute their hearts and muddy society, triggering an intensifying cycle of misery and evil, which will eventually become pervasive and permanent.\n\nThe Daishonin declared that in order to fulfill the great vow of the Buddha in such a perilous age, we must carry on the mission of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth and the practice of Bodhisattva Never Disparaging, and spread that mission and practice with deep confidence and conviction among people in society.\n\nHe went on to develop an extensive and detailed body of teachings for that purpose, and himself took the lead in putting them into practice. At the heart of the treatises and letters contained in this newly translated Spanish volume is the Daishonin\u2019s clarification of the mission and practice of bodhisattvas\u2014that is, to work for the happiness of oneself and others\u2014and also his instructions regarding how to encourage others to embrace this mission as well.\n\nThe Japanese text from which this Spanish edition is translated is the Soka Gakkai edition of the Nichiren Daishonin gosho zenshu (Collected Writings of Nichiren Daishonin). It was published in April 1952, about a year after my mentor Josei Toda was inaugurated as the second Soka Gakkai president.\n\nIn a sense, the full-scale development of the Soka Gakkai that took place under President Toda\u2019s leadership after World War II can be said to have begun in tandem with the publication of Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s writings. In the decades since, members in Japan have made the Daishonin\u2019s writings their foundation in faith and life while striving wholeheartedly to realize the Daishonin\u2019s vision of kosen-rufu to bring peace and happiness to humanity. In the process, they have brilliantly embodied the bodhisattva ideal presented in the Lotus Sutra.\n*\nHere, I would like to briefly discuss the spirit SGI members should adopt when reading the Daishonin\u2019s writings as a means for deepening their faith.\n\nReading the Daishonin\u2019s writings means connecting with the lofty, noble spirit of the Daishonin himself, who gave his life to protecting and propagating the correct teaching of Buddhism in order to relieve people from suffering. We can see the brilliant light of this spirit throughout his writings.\n\nFor instance, whenever I read the following passage\u2014\u201cThe sufferings that all living beings undergo, all springing from [the] one cause\u2014all these are Nichiren\u2019s own sufferings\u201d (WND-2, 934)\u2014I am always struck and humbled by the breadth of the Daishonin\u2019s compassion contained in this pledge and his resolve never to stand by in the face of people\u2019s suffering.\n\nInspired by the Daishonin\u2019s spirit, SGI members have stood up to emulate it in their own lives, even if only in some small way. They have empathized with others\u2019 sufferings, shared the message of supreme hope that we all possess the Buddha nature, offered warm support and encouragement, and helped people revitalize their lives. Through these efforts, they have created a growing network of hope across the globe based on the shining philosophy of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nAnother example of the Daishonin\u2019s lofty spirit is found in the passage: \u201cEven if it seems that, because I was born in the ruler\u2019s domain, I follow him in my actions, I will never follow him in my heart\u201d (WND-1, 579). Whenever I read it, I am moved to the very depths of my being. It is, in contemporary terms, a powerful affirmation of freedom of the spirit, freedom of belief, and freedom of thought.\n\nThe fundamental force for achieving those freedoms is fearlessness in the face of evil perpetrated by those in power. The Daishonin describes this fearlessness as the \u201cheart of a lion king\u201d (WND-1, 302). We can truly claim to have embodied the aforementioned passage of the Daishonin when we succeed in summoning this lionhearted spirit to overcome all hardships and lead lives of integrity and conscience.\n\nThe aim of studying the Daishonin\u2019s writings is to connect with his spirit and deepen our faith. Studying the profound teachings of Buddhism strengthens our conviction in the enduring and immutable hope, peace, and happiness that exist within us all. At the same time, by learning from the way the Daishonin triumphed over every obstacle, we can summon the courage to rise to the challenges we ourselves face. This is the eternal formula for practice-oriented Buddhist study.\n\nIt is my sincere hope that SGI members around the world will apply themselves to reading and studying the Daishonin\u2019s writings with an ever-fresh seeking spirit and deepening faith.\n\nFrom the preface*2 to the Spanish edition of The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin,\npublished on May 3, 2008.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1The three bodies of the Buddha refer to the Dharma body, the reward body, and the manifested body. The Dharma body is the fundamental truth, or Law, to which a Buddha is enlightened. The reward body is the wisdom to perceive the Law. And the manifested body is the compassionate actions the Buddha carries out to lead people to happiness.\n*2Translated into English from the original Japanese.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.9]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.1]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-1.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.1]\n20.1 Courage, Conviction, and Hope\n\u201cThere is nothing more precious than young people.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely nothing can compare to the youth.\u201d \u201cYoung people are a treasure\u2014no, the greatest of all treasures!\u201d\u2014these have been President Ikeda\u2019s consistent message.\n\nPresident Ikeda is a leader who loves young people and places immense trust in them, tirelessly encouraging them with compassionate concern. This chapter features some of his messages to youth.\n\nIn this selection, he stresses that the time of youth is important for building the foundation of our lives, and that courage, conviction, and hope are young people\u2019s great treasures.\n\nMost people have many memories of their youth, and I am no exception. Those who don\u2019t cannot really be said to have lived their youth fully.\n\nMy family was poor, and my four older brothers were all drafted into the army and sent to the battlefield during World War II. I found a job to support my family. Financial and time constraints meant that I had to continue my high school and college education at night while working during the day.\n\nMy health was also not very good. But I was determined to devote myself wholeheartedly to my job. Sometimes, when making deliveries for the company I worked for, I had to pull a large cart around the fashionable Ginza area. I also had to get by with only a single dress shirt, even when the cold autumn wind started to blow. But I never felt the least bit of shame or embarrassment because of that. In fact, I saw my struggles as the dramatic adventures of a youth challenging hardships with a smile, and even regarded them as a source of pride. It is certainly true that all of those youthful efforts became the foundation for my life today.\n\nAt that time, I was convinced\u2014or, should I say, determined\u2014that I would not to spend my youth in vain pursuits. I would make my way proudly in society, just as I was, developing my capabilities and living my life to the fullest. That determination, which sustained me in my youth, remains unchanged to this day. The greatest winners in life are those who ultimately triumph as human beings, irrespective of worldly position, wealth, and honor. I intend to remember this as long as I live.\n\nBut with the benefit of hindsight, there are some things I wish I could have done differently in my youth. For instance, I wish I could have acquired more in terms of my basic education in my 10s and 20s. I also wish that I had done more to build up a strong and healthy body. And though I realized the importance of my youthful days and read quite a few books at the time, today I deeply regret not having read 10 or 20 times that many.\n\nLooking back at my own youth, I keenly appreciate how important this period of one\u2019s life is. It is no exaggeration to say that how we spend our youth largely determines the rest of our lives.\n\nYoung people are works in progress, not yet complete. That\u2019s what makes each young person an unknown quantity with limitless potential. Youth are a vibrant force for new, positive change; they are bursting with energy and vitality. Nothing is more wonderful than this.\n\nI truly feel that courage, conviction, and hope are qualities vital for youth to possess. The courageous efforts of young people are a source of amazing creativity. And courage is supported by conviction. When we have conviction, we are free of hesitation or doubt. Conviction, in turn, is born of our efforts to fulfill our mission and responsibilities. The most outstanding individuals are those who hold fast to the ideals of their youth, to the dreams they had when they were young.\n\nYoung people are the treasures of a nation and the wealth of tomorrow\u2019s world. Nothing is more precious. Undermining the future of youth and robbing them of their vitality is like tossing that treasure into the sea. And leaders who tragically force young people to fight in wars, making them cast away their lives, are indeed the most reprehensible of villains.\n\nI love young people. Nothing delights me more than their growth. I am thrilled when I see them developing into wise, peace-loving, and happy individuals. I also cherish the hope that I may walk alongside them and maintain a youthful spirit as long as I live.\n\nMy one and only wish, and my greatest happiness, is that a steady stream of young people will soar forth, from the foundations we have built, to work for world peace and create a flourishing of culture.\n\nFrom Watashi wa ko omou (My Thoughts), published in Japanese in May 1969.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 19: Making the Writings of Nichiren Daishonin Our Foundation [19.10]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.2]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-2.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.2]\n20.2 The Problems of Youth Are Themselves a Source of Light\nWith warm compassion and empathy, President Ikeda wholeheartedly encourages young people. He urges them to learn to encourage themselves, to like themselves, and to use their problems as fuel to shine ever more brightly.\n\nYouth is a painful time. It is full of problems. But dealing with such troubles helps us grow as human beings. When we look back at the times we really suffered, the times we thought were the most miserable, we see that these were the most precious times of all.\n\nThat\u2019s why we need to grapple with our problems head-on, instead of trying to escape them. That is the most direct way forward.\n\nIf you\u2019re sad and lonely, then you should acknowledge those feelings. Don\u2019t try to distract yourself from them with shallow amusements. Don\u2019t diminish them. Go through those feelings, bravely weather them, and turn them into nourishment for your growth.\n*\nPeople, just like flowers, need light. People\u2019s hearts wither when no one values or cares about them. So please be the sun that imparts bright light to all.\n\nPeople, like flowers, also need water. Our hearts wither if we don\u2019t encourage ourselves, make ourselves happy, and spark our own enthusiasm.\n\nThose who can encourage themselves are truly inspiring. They understand the pain and suffering of others. Find the words, strength, and wisdom to bring happiness to your own heart. When you\u2019re feeling down, lift up your own spirits.\n\nIf you can\u2019t like yourself, you can\u2019t love others.\n*\nIf you\u2019re shy and sensitive, that\u2019s perfectly fine. Being thick-skinned and insensitive is not a requirement for being an adult. Flowers aren\u2019t made of concrete, either; they are soft, delicate, and fragile. Those who remain sensitive to others\u2019 thoughts and feelings their whole lives are truly strong.\n\nOur destiny does not come from somewhere outside us; it is shaped within our own hearts, day by day. If we find life boring, it might be because we\u2019ve let ourselves become boring. If life seems empty, it might be because we\u2019ve allowed ourselves to grow empty and shallow. If we feel fed up with life, then life might actually be saying the same to us! We can only lead lives that match the way we live them.\n\nIf you get average grades in school, that\u2019s fine, but please make sure you excel as a human being. Grades aren\u2019t the only measure of how smart or capable you are, and they really matter little in life over the long term. However, I hope you will earnestly pursue those questions that spark your curiosity, and think long and hard about them.\n\nAlso, I hope you will become a person who is willing, at the crucial moment, to stand up for truth and justice, regardless of the personal cost. As the presence of such individuals grows, the world will become a more beautiful place.\n\nSomewhere in the world a mission is waiting for you\u2014a mission that only you can fulfill. It is waiting for you, counting the days. Since that is the case, you must live, you must keep going until the day you encounter your mission!\n\nTo shine, you must burn with an inner light, and the fire that produces that inner light is fueled by problems and suffering.\n\nThe problems of youth are themselves a source of light.\n\nFrom an essay series \u201cThe Poetry of Light,\u201d published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, February 27, 2000.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.1]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.3]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-3.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.3]\n20.3 You Are Each a Precious Individual with a Special Mission\nPresident Ikeda stresses that we are all precious beings, each born with our own unique mission.\n\nEveryone has a mission. We were born because we have a mission. That\u2019s why we must live our lives and persevere through all.\n\nThe Japanese word for mission means to \u201cuse one\u2019s life.\u201d For what purpose do we use our lives? For what purpose have we been born in this world, sent forth from the universe?\n\nBuddhism views the universe as one giant life. If we compare it to a vast ocean, each individual life is like a wave on that ocean. When a wave rises from the ocean, that is \u201clife\u201d; when it merges back into the ocean, that is \u201cdeath.\u201d In both life and death, each individual life is one with the universe.\n\nThe whole universe supports and assists in the birth of a single life. All of you have been sent here with the blessings and congratulations of the entire universe!\n\nAll life is equally precious. There is no hierarchy among living beings. Each being has a unique nature. Each person\u2019s life is as precious as the universe in its entirety\u2014it is one with the universe and just as important.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes in this regard: \u201cLife is the foremost of all treasures\u201d (WND-1, 1125); \u201cThe Buddha says that life is something that cannot be purchased even for the price of an entire major world system\u201d (WND-1, 983); and \u201cOne day of life is more valuable than all the treasures of the major world system\u201d (WND-1, 955).\n\nThis is why we must never take our own lives, why violence, too, is wrong, and why we mustn\u2019t harm or bully others. It is because none of us has the right to inflict harm on life, which is so precious.\n\nYouth is a time when we ponder the meaning of our existence. It is like a \u201csecond birth.\u201d Our first birth is our physical birth. The second, our youth, is the time of our \u201cbirth\u201d as human beings in the real sense. That\u2019s why it\u2019s painful. It requires the same kind of struggle and exertion as a chick breaking out of its egg.\n\nThe crucial thing is to never give up in that process. As you struggle and strive to find your way, please chant, think, study, talk with friends, and tackle the things you need to do now. If you continue to challenge yourself without giving up, you will come to see the mission that is yours and yours alone to accomplish.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth II, published in Japanese in September 2000.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.2]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.4]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-4.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.4]\n20.4 Seeking Out Challenges for Self-Development in One\u2019s Youth\nPresident Ikeda explains that a springtime of exhilarating victory comes to those who remain true to their vow and convictions, actively seek out challenges, and develop themselves in their youth.\n\nOnly those who have experienced the harshness of winter can truly know the joy of spring. The same is true of life.\n\nThe Swiss philosopher Carl Hilty asserted: \u201cWhat joy is, is essentially known only to those who have suffered much. Others know only pleasure, which is in no way similar.\u201d*1 Those who haven\u2019t experienced suffering cannot know real joy\u2014how true that is!\n\nHilty also wisely observed: \u201cHappiness in life is not a matter of having few or no hardships but, rather, of victoriously and gloriously overcoming them all.\u201d*2\n\nTrue happiness in life lies in triumphing over every obstacle, he says. This point of view is quite similar to the Buddhist teaching that sufferings arising from earthly desires are the springboard to enlightenment.\n\nThere are some people who try to make their way through life without exerting any genuine effort, who try to profit and get ahead without putting in any hard work. Do they achieve real happiness? False veneers are eventually exposed, and pretense can only get one so far.\n\nIn the natural world, winter always turns to spring. What is needed in our human world for that to happen?\n\nHilty declared: \u201cBreak through!\u2014this short phrase has an almost magical effect each time we face an inner crisis.\u201d*3 Persevere through all; continue, no matter what difficulty. Persevering is the secret to everything, he concludes.\n\nTo paraphrase Hilty: When your mind seems ready to drift off to sleep, or when you are overcome by a feeling of lethargy\u2014tell yourself: Break through! This short phrase delivers a shock to a healthy will and awakens it. The elevated spirit is once again free to move toward the truth, toward what\u2019s right and just. When you feel yourself succumbing to feelings of futility or apathy, rouse yourself and press on through!\n\nWe all experience problems and deadlocks from time to time\u2014it might be with Soka Gakkai activities, with work, or with human relations. That\u2019s the time to persevere. Continue pressing forward and win your own victory. That\u2019s the only way.\n\nThere may be times when life itself seems a burden, when we feel trapped or weighed down by something, when we feel passive and a victim of circumstances, or when we feel somehow lost. Those are the times to shed our passivity and turn it into initiative, telling ourselves, \u201cI\u2019m going to follow through on this path!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to carry out my mission for today!\u201d When we decide to do so, a genuine spring will dawn in our hearts, and flowers will start to bloom.\n\nPersevering for us means continuing in our efforts to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and share Nichiren Buddhism with one person after another. We who know this sure and practical way for transforming winter into spring are fortunate indeed.\n*\nIt is my fervent wish that a steady stream of outstanding Soka Gakkai leaders for the 21st century will emerge from the youth division. Because of my strong hopes in that regard, I want to reiterate my advice that you continue to seek out challenges.\n\nMr. Toda often said: \u201cWhy did I become the president of the Soka Gakkai? It is because I lost my wife. I lost my beloved daughter. And because I have experienced all kinds of bitter hardships. That is the reason I became president.\u201d Because he had undergone great hardships, he was qualified to be president\u2014this was Mr. Toda\u2019s philosophy.\n\nExperiencing various hardships enables us to deepen our faith.\n\nI still vividly recall the words of the Japanese industrialist [and founder of the Panasonic Corporation] Konosuke Matsushita, with whom I shared many conversations: \u201cMr. Ikeda, how true it is that people ought to struggle during their youth and even deliberately seek out hard work!\u201d\n\nThese days, many people try to avoid hard work. They seem to feel that working hard is old-fashioned or a waste of energy. However, this is certainly not the case. In essence, all of our efforts are for our own sake.\n\nWe live in an age in which people can easily indulge themselves as much as they like and leave everything up to others. Making efforts to train and develop oneself is not considered important. But such an attitude has caused many to lose their sense of purpose and identity.\n\nBecause of this prevailing climate, those resolved to actively seek out hard work will gain great reward and benefit. Those who thoroughly develop themselves and forge an undefeatable self will be victorious.\n\nWhere can we find such a wonderful realm of self-development? It is here in the Soka Gakkai. Here, we find the path for securing supreme victory in life.\n\nFrom a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Tokyo, June 28, 1995.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Translated from German.

Your will and your foot that desires to step out beyond you\u2014let them be your new honour!\u201d*1\n\nHis message is that everything starts from now! Always look to the future! Buddhism also teaches the spirit of focusing on the present and the future.\n\nA meaningful life\u2014and, in particular, a meaningful youth\u2014is built not by focusing on the past, but on how you live from now on. That positive, forward-looking attitude is the key to greatness and victory.\n\nTo continually apply yourself to the task of going beyond where you are today\u2014that spirit of self-improvement is the very heart of youth.\n\nPresident Toda urged young people to \u201cstrive constantly to improve themselves, to become more dignified and cultured, and to establish a better, greater self.\u201d*2 Develop yourself! This was his message to the youth. He also often encouraged them to read books and ponder things deeply.\n\nYou are the future leaders of society and kosen-rufu. That\u2019s why you need to think more deeply and strive more vigorously than those around you. Please take the initiative in working and studying hard.\n\nWhen you adopt that attitude, your eyes will sparkle and you\u2019ll enjoy a sense of fulfillment. If, on the other hand, you try to avoid hard work, you will lose your youthful freshness and vitality.\n\nI continue to challenge myself, taking action and engaging in dialogue, with the spirit to put a week\u2019s worth, a month\u2019s worth, of effort into each day. I do it all for you, my fellow members, and for kosen-rufu. I never forget this guiding purpose.\n\nLiving without working to improve oneself leads to stagnation and, ultimately, self-defeat.\n\nThere are those who fail to work on their own growth and development, using only their wits and wiles to get by. But the closing chapter of their lives is often empty and sad. They end up regretting the choices they made. They wish they could go back to their youth and do things differently.\n\nThere is a time for everything. If you have every material comfort and the freedom to do anything you please from the time of your youth, you are actually rather unfortunate. It\u2019s important that you forge inner strength and develop yourself in your youth. With such a foundation, it\u2019s only natural that once you reach a certain age your life will blossom, and you\u2019ll enjoy both spiritual and material rewards. This is the correct path in life.\n\nFrom a speech at a Chugoku Region youth peace general meeting, Tokyo, May 7, 1995.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Friedrich Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for Everyone and No One, translated by\nR.

Victory and success shine in tenacious efforts to keep moving forward, undefeated by any obstacle.\n\nNothing is irredeemable in youth. The only real mistake you can make when you are young is giving up on yourself or allowing fear of failure to prevent you from trying to accomplish something.\n\nThe past is the past; the future is the future. Look to the future and keep moving forward, telling yourself: \u201cEverything starts from today\u2014it starts from now, this minute, this moment!\u201d This is the essence of Nichiren Buddhism, the Buddhism of \u201ctrue cause.\u201d*1\n\nTrue success or failure in life will not be apparent until you reach your 40s or 50s.\n\nDon\u2019t allow your immediate situation to make you lose hope or panic. Though you may do something you regret, have problems, or make mistakes, the future is long. Don\u2019t be a fainthearted person who frets or despairs over every little thing.\n\nWhen we look at the lives of famous people, we find that many had a far from perfect youth. For example, Sir Winston Churchill was well known for failing in school. Mahatma Gandhi, too, was a mediocre student. He was shy, timid, and found it difficult to talk to others. Albert Einstein also didn\u2019t do well in some of his school subjects\u2014though, of course, he was brilliant at mathematics. Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, who discovered X-rays, was expelled from technical college because his classmates falsely accused him of something they themselves had done.\n\nBut what did all these individuals have in common in their youth? They never gave up on themselves. People who get poor grades, who are bullied, who are betrayed by their friends, who fail, who have to deal with such problems as illness or poverty, are more likely to be able to understand others\u2019 feelings and have deep insights into life. The important thing, therefore, is not to be defeated. If you can do that, whatever suffering you have had to endure will definitely contribute in a positive way to your growth in the future.\n\nYou must love, respect, and treasure yourself. You\u2019ll be miserable if you allow yourself to be swayed by the prejudices, passing trends, and contradictions of society. Never forget to be who you are, to be true to yourself.\n\nMr. Toda sternly observed that the sense of happiness we feel in the final years of our life is what counts. It\u2019s got nothing to do with how well things go in your youth. Similarly, no matter how many times you fail at something when you\u2019re young, there\u2019s plenty of time to recover and get yourself back on course.\n\nNever lose hope, never lose your aspiration to do better. If you don\u2019t do well in elementary school, there\u2019s always junior high. And if not in junior high school, then there is high school, college, and your entry into society after graduation. And if you experience setbacks along the way after that, continue challenging yourself into your 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s.\n\nMoreover, from the profound perspective of Nichiren Buddhism, if you don\u2019t accomplish all you set out to in this lifetime, you can continue to fight on in the next lifetime and on for eternity. Faith in Nichiren Buddhism means cherishing the highest aspiration.\n\nEven if you think you\u2019re hopeless and incapable, I know you\u2019re not. I have not the slightest doubt that each of you has a mission. No matter what others may say, I will always respect you and believe in you. No matter what your present situation is, I am absolutely certain that a wonderful future awaits you.\n\nIf you should fall, just get right back up. If you can pick yourself up, you can move forward. You are young. Now is the time for challenge and construction. Start from the present moment. Begin something, here and now.\n*\nIn every era, there is serious suffering. And in every era, youth is a time full of worries and emotional turmoil. School is not the only issue. There is family, health, looks, relationships, friends\u2014all sorts of problems to deal with. There is suffering, anxiety, frustration, and sadness. Youth is a time of grappling with all sorts of problems.\n\nStruggling for answers, dispelling dark clouds and moving toward the sun, toward hope\u2014this is the power of youth. Of course, you will have problems, make mistakes, and have regrets. But what matters is not allowing them to defeat you. Just keep pressing forward, ever forward, pushing through all problems and suffering.\n\nSuppose you are lost in the jungle. You want to find your way out and reach the ocean but don\u2019t know which way to go. What will you do? The answer is, keep moving ahead along any course until you come to a river. Then, if you follow the river downstream, you will eventually reach the ocean.\n\nMove forward. As you struggle, chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and keep pressing ahead, even if only a millimeter, two millimeters. If you keep that up all your life, when you finally look back, you\u2019ll see you\u2019ve made your way out of the jungle.\n\nThe more you suffer, the more sadness you experience, and the more daimoku you chant, the more profound a life you will lead. All will serve to nourish your growth into leaders of the 21st century.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth, published in Japanese in March 1999.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1True cause: Also, mystic principle of the true cause. Nichiren Buddhism directly expounds the true cause for enlightenment as Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, which is the Law of life and the universe. It teaches a way of Buddhist practice of always moving forward from this moment on based on this fundamental Law.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.5]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.7]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-7.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.7]\n20.7 Live with an Invincible Spirit\nYouth can be a time of emotional ups and downs, of being overly swayed by circumstances and feeling a sense of hopelessness and despair. For that reason, in this guidance for junior high school division members, President Ikeda stresses the importance of young people forging ahead with an invincible spirit.\n\nFortunate circumstances don\u2019t guarantee happiness, and, conversely, hard circumstances don\u2019t guarantee that one will be unhappy.\n\nOur environment doesn\u2019t decide our happiness; we do. We are either defeated by our environment or we triumph over it. That\u2019s what determines our happiness.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t just apply to school. There are many troubling, painful, unpleasant, and worrisome things in life.\n\nWhen you face such things, you have two options. You can complain, blame the environment, and be defeated. Some may express sympathy for you, but, ultimately, you\u2019re the one to lose out, and anything you say will really be just an excuse. The second option is to live with an invincible spirit, blazing your own way regardless of your environment. The choice is up to you.\n\nIn India, the caste system remains a deeply rooted social custom. It divides people into different social roles and ranks from birth. But there is someone who, though born into the lowest caste, rose to become president of India.\n\nThat is the current president [in 2000], Mr. K. R. Narayanan, with whom I have been friends for some time. Mr. Narayanan was the fourth of seven children. The family was destitute. Their home had no bath, and he was always hungry. Going to school each day meant walking seven kilometers there and back. During the rainy season, the mud came up to his ankles. On those long walks, he was always reading. He couldn\u2019t afford to buy books, so he would eagerly read any newspapers or books he came across and take detailed notes.\n\nRecognizing his love of study, Mr. Narayanan\u2019s elder siblings gave up their chance to go to elementary school so that he could get an education. But even then, the family often could not afford to pay his tuition. He was punished for this by being forced to stand outside the classroom, but he refused to let this get him down. He would simply strain to hear every word of instruction going on inside. Eventually, he was awarded a scholarship, one that had been established by Mahatma Gandhi, and was able to continue his studies. He graduated from university at the top of his class and became a diplomat. He recalls his youthful hardships with a smile. Because a diplomat had to be thick-skinned, he says, being forced to stand outside where all of his classmates could see him was good training.\n\nHe is a strong person. Strong people are happy. Happiness is found in a strong, resilient spirit.\n\nIt\u2019s possible for us to open a great path of hope so long as we don\u2019t succumb to the weakness of blaming others for everything that happens to us. We have to decide, \u201cIt\u2019s all up to me! I have to be strong.\u201d Complaining and making excuses is very unattractive. Blaming everything on your teachers, your parents, your friends\u2014blaming others is not a very admirable way to live.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte declared that the environment was his to make. Decide never to blame your environment, but instead to create the environment you desire.\n\nI have always believed that, as young people with a mission, you cannot be defeated. Because you were born to win! Therefore, take aim at your dreams and strive your hardest to make them come true.\n\nEven if you take a long, roundabout way to get there, what matters is that you succeed in crossing the finish line in the end. Become strong. Strong people are happy people.\n\nThose who respond to painful circumstances by gritting their teeth and trying their hardest can obtain a rare and elusive treasure. In contrast, weak people, no matter how favorable their circumstances, will somehow turn those circumstances into a negative influence in their lives.\n\nThe way of life you choose determines your future. No one else makes the decision. No one else is to blame. It\u2019s entirely up to you, to how you live your life.\n\nIf you just let your environment control you, it becomes the main actor in your life. That is a regrettable way to live. You are the main actor, the one who determines the course of your own life.\n\nFrom Dialogue of Hope, published in Japanese in June 2003.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.6]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.8]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-8.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.8]\n20.8 To Young Women\u2019s Division Members\nOn entering a new century, President Ikeda offers important guidance for young women\u2019s division members with the wish that each one of them without exception will become genuinely happy.\n\nIn a letter to a female disciple [the lay nun Ueno], Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cNeither the pure land nor hell exists outside oneself; both lie only within one\u2019s own heart. Awakened to this, one is called a Buddha; deluded about it, one is called an ordinary person\u201d (WND-1. 456).\n\nHappiness and hell are within you, inside your own hearts and minds.\n\nBeing a celebrity doesn\u2019t guarantee happiness. Neither does popularity. Honors and accolades are not true happiness, nor is wealth.\n\nTrue happiness lies in tapping the inner source of eternal, indestructible, absolute happiness that is Nam-myoho-renge-kyo\u2014shining in the depths of your being that is still a work in progress\u2014as you strive to cultivate your own life. This is the essence of Buddhism.\n\nThe aim of our faith is for us to win in life. Buddhism is a set of principles to enable us to do so.\n\nTo gloriously triumph in life, we need to strive just as always in our daily lives, carrying out our everyday responsibilities, and forge ahead with ever greater strength on the road of kosen-rufu.\n\nWhen you do that, your life will shine with an endlessly noble spirit. The countless Buddhas of the ten directions and three existences will protect all of you\u2014inspiring, unsung emissaries of the Buddha\u2014as foremost champions of the world.\n\nDon\u2019t allow yourself to be swept away by illusions. You cannot become happy by following people who are ignorant of the principles for genuine happiness. The absolutely correct way is to follow the Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin, a true champion of humanity who left us the great pathway to happiness.\n\nNever forget that a wonderful luminous realm of eternal victory awaits those who embrace this teaching.\n\nThe course of your life is determined by whose lead you follow. Do you follow calculating politicians, vain pretenders, or greedy schemers? Do not be deceived. Your decisive choice must be to follow Nichiren Daishonin, the entity of the universe itself.\n\nNo matter what kind of father, mother, or siblings you may have, if you attain Buddhahood, you can lead all of them to enlightenment as well. The heart of Soka lies in building a happy, strong self.\n\nMany labor under the delusion that marriage equals happiness. Remaining single by no means excludes you from enjoying happiness. The important thing is to build an unshakable self, set on a foundation of correct faith. This is the way to true happiness.\n\nBirds who don\u2019t fly lose the ability to do so. They lose the use of their wings and can\u2019t soar into the skies of happiness. An Olympic athlete who doesn\u2019t run or doesn\u2019t train cannot win. Lazy people who don\u2019t strive, don\u2019t act, don\u2019t advance, end up losing in life.\n\nStriving and progressing for some purpose or goal\u2014this is the essence of happiness. If, from your youth, you strive tirelessly for the sake of others, for Buddhism, what an amazing person you will become! While carrying out your human revolution, you will build a truly expansive state of life.\n\nAs you may know, my wife, Kaneko, attended the inaugural meeting of the young women\u2019s division as a group leader [in 1951], and with Tokyo as her main stage of activity from her youth, has dedicated herself wholeheartedly to kosen-rufu.\n\nProud to be a Tokyo young women\u2019s division member [like all of you], she braved the cold winter winds during the historic February Campaign*1 of Kamata Chapter [in 1952] to engage actively in sharing the Daishonin\u2019s Buddhism with friends and encouraging members.\n\nHer parent\u2019s home was also a center for Soka Gakkai activities, so she invited her superiors at work to discussion meetings, helped make gatherings bright and enjoyable, and smilingly greeted the members who gathered there day and night. As a young women\u2019s division member, she would happily and kindly read picture books with the children of women\u2019s division members during meetings.\n\nThough no one was watching or praising her, she carried out the vow she made to President Makiguchi and worked to support President Toda. She assisted her mother, the chapter women\u2019s division leader, encouraged her father, the district men\u2019s division leader, and continued to strive for kosen-rufu with dedication, sincerity, and perseverance.\n\nThat exhilarating time as a young women\u2019s division member, my wife recalls, was the most memorable period of her life, when she built the foundation for her life and her Buddhist faith and practice.\n\nYour fellow members around the world are all earnestly walking the path to absolute happiness. The Mystic Law, the great underlying principle of the universe! There is no other path to peace in the 21st century.\n\nLet\u2019s advance along that path together! Social standing, wealth, position, and family background have nothing to do with happiness. And thinking you would be happy if things just went the way you wanted, or if you could just do this or that, is not really Buddhism.\n\n\u201cIt is the heart that is important\u201d (WND-1, 1000), declares the Daishonin. The heart is faith, and faith is an essential requirement for happiness.\n\nThe key is to become happy right here and now, in your present situation and circumstances, just as you are.\n\nMy young friends, be pioneers of life! Be great victors of happiness! Don\u2019t lose yourself in idle, empty, mundane pleasures and amusements! Take your place at the head of the march to fundamental happiness!\n\nAll of the heavenly deities as well as the Buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout the universe, radiant and dancing with joy, will protect your vibrant lives, shower you with the highest praises, and guide you on your journey to happiness.\n\nFrom a message to a Tokyo young women\u2019s division chapter leaders meeting, February 9, 2001.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1February Campaign: In February 1952, President Ikeda, then an adviser to Tokyo\u2019s Kamata Chapter, initiated a dynamic propagation campaign. Together with the Kamata members, he broke through the previous monthly record of some 100 new member households by introducing Nichiren Buddhism to 201 new member households.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.7]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.9]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-9.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.9]\n20.9 True Happiness Is Having Good Friends\nHaving good friends and seniors in faith is the key to leading lives of genuine happiness, President Ikeda says, sharing important guidance for young women\u2019s division members.\n\nToday, I\u2019d like to discuss something important with you, the young women\u2019s division members: true happiness.\n\nDoes getting married mean you\u2019ll be happy, and does not getting married mean you\u2019ll be unhappy? The answer to these questions is no. Life is not that simple. It is extremely complex and subtle. A person who has been happy until now may fall into the depths of despair tomorrow. A person whose life has been a series of unhappy events may suddenly experience a complete change of fortune. Moreover, people who may appear to enjoy the happiest of circumstances may in fact be miserable inside. And likewise, people whose circumstances seem unfortunate may actually lead the most fulfilling and vibrant lives.\n\nHappiness is a matter of the heart. Our hearts are precious vessels endowed with the treasure of Buddhahood. When we strive in faith and practice and reveal our Buddhahood, we can walk the sure and steady path to happiness and attain a state of complete fulfillment and satisfaction. Nichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cFortune comes from one\u2019s heart and makes one worthy of respect\u201d (WND-1, 1137). I hope that all of you will follow this correct course in life. To do so, it\u2019s crucial to continue advancing in the pure realm of faith that is the Soka Gakkai.\n\nIn The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, the Daishonin states:\n\n\u201cNichiren and his followers, those who chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, one and all will \u2018together reach the place where the treasure is.\u2019 This one word \u2018together\u2019 means that, as long as they are together with Nichiren, they will reach the treasure land [the realm of Buddhahood]. But if they are not together with him, they will fall into the great citadel of the Avichi Hell [the hell of incessant suffering].\u201d (OTT, 77\u201378)\n\nThe Soka Gakkai has striven in faith, practice, and study in complete accord with the Daishonin\u2019s teachings. It has fought resolutely against the three obstacles and four devils*1 and the three powerful enemies.*2 We have exerted ourselves \u201cbravely and vigorously\u201d (LSOC2, 56) for kosen-rufu as a harmonious community of practitioners united in the spirit of \u201cmany in body, one in mind,\u201d just as the Daishonin instructs. Therefore, to live out our lives with the Soka Gakkai is the only path by which we can walk together with the Daishonin and \u201creach the place where the treasure is.\u201d\n\nIn concrete terms, it is essential for you, our young women\u2019s division members, to have good seniors in faith and good friends\u2014people you can talk with about anything. Don\u2019t separate yourselves from such good people. Please don\u2019t suffer alone with your problems, making reckless choices and ending up on the wrong course.\n\nIf you allow bad friends to influence you, you\u2019ll head in a negative direction. But if you form connections with good people, you will experience positive growth. This is human nature, and it is my conclusion after observing countless people over the years.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to be preoccupied with getting married either. Whether to get married or when to get married are minor issues from the perspective of life\u2019s eternity. Marriage by no means decides the outcome of your life. If you persist in your faith, you are sure to attain happiness. My wish is that all our young women\u2019s division members will advance confidently along the path of Soka filled with hope and courage.\n\nAt the same time, I call on the members of the women\u2019s and men\u2019s divisions to warmly and sincerely advise the young women\u2019s division members, offering them wholehearted support and encouragement.\n\nYour youth is incredibly precious, an extremely important period when you lay the foundation for the rest of your life. While you are young, I hope you will seek out good mentors, learn from good seniors, foster mutually supportive relationships with good friends, and raise good juniors. I also hope you will be daughters who treasure your parents.\n\nI\u2019d like to present our young women\u2019s division members with these words of Hryhory (Gregory) Skovoroda, often called the \u201cUkrainian Socrates\u201d: \u201cI pity the wealthy: Let them rule over what they want. As for me, as long as I have friends, I consider myself not only fortunate, but most fortunate.\u201d*3\n\nThe young women of Soka cherish a true philosophy and work alongside true comrades in faith to expand our circle of true friendship. They are walking a path to genuine happiness far superior to any enjoyed by those who seek only wealth or power.\n\nFrom a speech at a young women\u2019s division and women\u2019s division joint conference, Tokyo, February 14, 2006.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Three obstacles and four devils: Various obstacles and hindrances to the practice of Buddhism. The three obstacles are (1) the obstacle of earthly desires, (2) the obstacle of karma, and (3) the obstacle of retribution.

Discussing this passage, President Ikeda teaches young people the importance of having appreciation for one\u2019s parents.\n\nOnce during an informal discussion with youth division members, Mr. Toda asked us who among Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s disciples we liked the most. I fondly recall replying without hesitation: \u201cNanjo Tokimitsu.\u201d\n\nWhen Tokimitsu was only seven years old,*1 his father, a man of great integrity, died of illness. The young boy met the Daishonin for the first time shortly thereafter, when the latter came to pray at his father\u2019s grave, an encounter that would stay with him forever. From that time on, he looked up to the Daishonin as his teacher and, with his mother, strove earnestly in faith.\n\nTokimitsu studied and trained himself, growing into a fine young man. When he was 16, he went to visit the Daishonin who had moved to Mount Minobu. The Daishonin was no doubt delighted to see what an outstanding youth Tokimitsu had become. He sent him this letter, \u201cThe Four Virtues and the Four Debts of Gratitude,\u201d the following year [1275]. In it, he instructs Tokimitsu that being a good son to the parents who raised him and repaying the debt of gratitude he owes them is the path of Buddhism.\n\nThe direct meaning of the passage \u201cA person who upholds the Lotus Sutra is repaying the debt of gratitude owed to father and mother\u201d (WND-2, 638) is that upholding the Lotus Sutra is itself being good to one\u2019s parents. In other words, the Lotus Sutra has the power to repay the debt we owe them. This passage can also be read as a message to Tokimitsu that those who believe in the Mystic Law must not forget to have appreciation for their parents.\n\nOne passage of Mr. Toda\u2019s famous \u201cGuidelines for Youth\u201d reads:\n\n\u201cOur struggle is one that requires that we develop compassion for all living beings. Yet there are so many young people who are incapable of having compassion for their own parents. How can they be expected to care about perfect strangers? The effort to overcome the coldness and indifference in our own lives and attain the same state of compassion as the Buddha is the essence of human revolution.\u201d*2\n\nLove and gratitude for one\u2019s parents are the foundation of genuine humanity.\n\nOutstanding people invariably care for and treasure their parents. I have seen this through the friendships I have forged with leaders around the world.\n\nIn his letter, the Daishonin reminds Tokimitsu that his mother, when carrying him in her womb, must have undergone suffering that was close to death, while the pain she endured at the time of giving birth to him is almost too great to imagine (cf. WND-2, 637).\n\nYour mothers have undoubtedly endured terrible pain to give birth to you. Giving birth is truly a life-and-death struggle. On that point alone, we should feel and show gratitude to our mothers.\n\nThat\u2019s why Mr. Toda was always very stern with those who didn\u2019t treat their parents well. He once thundered at a youth who made his parents worry: \u201cDon\u2019t you know how much pain you\u2019re causing your parents?!\u201d\n\nImmediately after the passage I have quoted, the Daishonin writes: \u201cEven if one does not feel in one\u2019s own heart that one can do so, one can repay it [the debt of gratitude owed to one\u2019s father and mother] through the power of this sutra\u201d (WND-2, 638).\n\nWhat he means by these words is that the Mystic Law has the power to lead all people to happiness. By chanting deeply with faith in the Mystic Law and powerfully living a good and correct life, we activate the positive functions of the universe and naturally develop a life state in which we can appreciate and treasure our parents.\n\nThe parents of many of you are exerting themselves earnestly as Soka Gakkai members, day after day, striving with tenacity and determination for the cause of the highest good. Together with me, they are dedicating their lives to realizing the supremely lofty mission of kosen-rufu.\n\nThough they are working for the highest good, they may sometimes be unjustly scorned and criticized. Patiently enduring such bitter experiences, they are devoting themselves to the welfare of others, to Buddhism, and to society, pressing onward with unflagging fortitude. Their committed efforts make them more admirable than any celebrity or authority.\n\nThe Soka Gakkai was built by such great, yet unheralded, ordinary individuals. Steadfastly engaging one person after another in dialogue, they have built the Soka Gakkai into a remarkable global movement for peace, culture, and education.\n\nThey have also made such tireless efforts in order to open the way for your victory, motivated by their desire to bring good fortune and benefit to you, their beloved children.\n\nThough they may not say it in words, they are exerting themselves unsparingly for you, chanting, working, and striving as hard as they can. Such is a parent\u2019s love.\n\nYou are deeply embraced and staunchly protected by your parents\u2019 prayers for your health, growth, and happiness.\n\nI hope that you will be proud to have such parents. I also hope that you will come to recognize their sincere dedication to their Buddhist practice and to the Soka Gakkai, and that you will become people of great wisdom and substance who respect and appreciate your parents from the bottom of your hearts, and who do your best to repay your debt of gratitude to them.\n\nPerhaps some of you, like Tokimitsu, have lost one or both of your parents. But please remember that they live on in your hearts. When you chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, they are there in the Gohonzon. They are always with you at the deepest level of life.\n\nPerhaps some of you have parents who are not Soka Gakkai members, or with whom you have troubled or challenging relationships. In any case, please pray with open hearts for their happiness.\n\nStand up bravely on your own and live strongly based on faith. Triumph in your youth, and win boldly in life. Study hard, develop your minds and bodies, and become great leaders of kosen-rufu and society.\n\nTrying your hardest now, even if it\u2019s a struggle, is the very best way to repay your debt of gratitude to your parents. Such a sincere attitude will also make the spirit of mentor and disciple shine in your lives.\n\nI hope that you will carry on the spirit of your parents, the Soka Gakkai, and the heritage of Soka mentors and disciples.\n\nFrom a study series The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin and the Mentor-Disciple Relationship, published in Japanese in September 2010.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1The ages for Nanjo Tokimitsu here and below are according to the traditional Japanese custom of counting a person\u2019s age as one year from the day of birth.\n*2Translated from Japanese.

For young people, in particular, trustworthiness is their greatest asset. A young person who fails to build trust is very unlikely to succeed.\n\nTrust is difficult to build, yet easy to destroy. The trust one has worked hard to accumulate over a decade can be lost by a thoughtless word or action at a crucial moment. Carefully crafted facades tend to crumble at a critical juncture.\n\nThose who persevere through hardships to carry out their own mission will ultimately win the trust of all around them.\n\nI reserve the highest respect and admiration for those who, though having jobs that may be unexciting and out of the limelight, conscientiously apply themselves to their work, day in and day out, and patiently keep striving to improve themselves, one step at a time.\n\nThough the trust of others is indeed precious, it can be ruinous for young people to adopt an overly cautious attitude, always playing it safe. The failures you experience at times in your youth can be incredibly valuable in building the foundation for your future. Young people should be aware of the fact that they are not perfect, and try to live each day with courage, true to themselves.\n\nThose who lead resolute lives, who possess an invincible spirit and are able to rise up from the depths of despair like phoenixes from the ashes, are much more likely to achieve brilliant victory in the end than those who have never experienced failure or disappointment. We should not be afraid of failure or mistakes, but of letting them defeat us.\n\nAllowing one or two setbacks to discourage us is foolish. Life is a long, long journey. However wonderful or successful our lives may seem along the way, if we end up suffering unhappiness and defeat in our final years, nothing could be more tragic.\n\nPlease advance courageously with the conviction that the more mistakes you make in your youth, the more you can build the foundation for a new chapter in your life and lifelong happiness.\n\nIt\u2019s also important as young people to have the guts and integrity to honestly admit your errors. Never be so cowardly as to refuse to admit your mistakes and instead blame them on others.\n\nBeing open-minded enough to calmly reflect and pinpoint where you went wrong can become the source of future value creation.\n\nThere is nothing more reassuring, refreshing, or beautiful than young people striving hard toward a goal. Nothing in all the world is more beautiful than the earnest struggles of youth.\n\nFrom Watashi wa ko omou (My Thoughts), published in Japanese in May 1969.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.10]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.12]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-12.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.12]\n20.12 Our Workplace Is an Important Stage for Our Human Revolution\nPresident Ikeda offers warmhearted advice to young people about work based on his own experience and the guidance of President Toda.\n\nConcerns about work can occupy a big place in the minds of young people. They may wonder what kind of work they are best suited for, or if their present job is the right one for them.\n\nI had many of the same concerns when I was young. When I began working for Mr. Toda\u2019s publishing company, I started out as the editor of a boys\u2019 magazine. It was something I\u2019d always wanted to do, but the company\u2019s business declined and the magazine was discontinued. I was then transferred to the kind of work I liked least, involved with finance. Additionally, there was a period when I didn\u2019t even receive my monthly salary. I couldn\u2019t buy an overcoat when winter came. But I never uttered a single word of complaint. My sole wish was to overcome the crisis facing Mr. Toda\u2019s businesses, and I worked single-mindedly toward that end.\n\nMr. Toda offered this advice to young people who were struggling with regard to their work:\n\n\u201cThere are three criteria for selecting a job\u2014beauty, benefit, and good. Everyone\u2019s ideal is to get a job they like (beauty), that is financially secure (benefit), and where they can contribute to society (good). But the real world is not always that accommodating. Very few people find the job of their dreams from the very beginning. In most cases, we have to do work that we never expected we would do.\u201d*1\n\nFor example, our job may provide us a secure livelihood and contribute to society, but isn\u2019t something we enjoy or really suits us temperamentally. (It provides benefit and good, but not beauty.)\n\nOr we may have a job that we enjoy and contributes to society, but it may not provide us with enough money to support ourselves. (It has beauty and good, but not benefit.)\n\nOr our job may pay extremely well and be enjoyable, but have a negative effect on society. (It has benefit and beauty, but not good.)\n\nAs we can see, it can actually be quite difficult to attain all three values of beauty, benefit, and good. In the today\u2019s trying economic times, in particular, it is increasingly difficult to find a job at all.\n\nWhat should we do then? Mr. Toda advised:\n\n\u201cIn times such as these, young people should not be discouraged. Just put all your energy into your present job and become an indispensable person there. By chanting earnestly to the Gohonzon and continuing to strive your hardest, not letting disagreeable tasks or assignments deter you, you will eventually find a job that you enjoy, offers financial security, and produces good for society. This is the benefit of faith.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s not all. When you look back at your less than satisfactory jobs, you\u2019ll find that none of your hard work was wasted, but that it has all become a valuable asset for you. You\u2019ll come to understand that everything had meaning. I can assure you of this from my own experience. Our faith is expressed in our lives and in society. That is the power of Buddhism.\u201d*2\n\nMr. Toda was a leader of unparalleled genius. I know from my own experience that what he says about work is true.\n\nThe important thing is to strive to win where you are now.\n\nBuddhism teaches that our lives are inherently and eternally endowed with Buddhahood and that this suffering-filled saha world in which we live is itself the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light [the Buddha land].\n\nTherefore, shine where you are. By throwing yourselves into your work rather than avoiding it, you will definitely open a way forward in the best possible direction. Eventually, you will come to appreciate that all your efforts up to now had meaning, and everything you have experienced is a treasure for your lives. And when you do, you will be victors.\n\nYoung people who uphold the Mystic Law are happy. They will lead lives of satisfaction and fulfillment without fail.\n\nI would like you to develop a life state where you can declare: \u201cI am a truly fortunate youth. All my struggles are themselves a source of happiness.\u201d\n\nThe true nature of such a person\u2019s life will reveal itself in their outward appearance and actions, in accord with the principle of the true aspect of all phenomena.*3\n\nAs long as you are lamenting your situation, looking gloomy and downcast, you\u2019ll be miserable and no one will recognize your abilities.\n\nYou\u2019re far better off being upbeat and active. It will open the way to new possibilities. Your attitude determines everything.\n\nI want each of you to be successful in your respective fields. You can\u2019t be a success if you make halfhearted efforts. You need to follow through on your chosen path to the very end.\n\nTo do that, look at your job as your place of training where you build and develop yourself as a human being. This place of training as a human being is also your place of Buddhist practice, the place where you put your faith into practice. If you can adopt this outlook, all your complaints will disappear. Nothing is more pitiful than a person who is always complaining.\n\nFrom a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Tokyo, June 28, 1995.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Translated from Japanese.

Through the explanation of the ten factors, the \u201cExpedient Means\u201d (2nd) chapter of the Lotus Sutra teaches that all people are inherently endowed with the potential to become Buddhas, and clarifies the truth that they can tap and manifest this potential.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.11]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.13]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-13.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.13]\n20.13 Work and Faith Are One and Inseparable\nPresident Ikeda discusses the attitude with which young people should apply themselves at work as practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cRegard your service to your lord as the practice of the Lotus Sutra. This is what is meant by \u2018No worldly affairs of life or work are ever contrary to the true reality\u2019\u201d*1 (WND-1, 905). In other words, we should treat our work as part of our Buddhist practice and recognize that all human affairs are manifestations of the Mystic Law.\n\nWhatever your job, whatever your position, it is important that you, as a person who chants Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, bring forth wisdom and sincerely do your best to create value for the happiness of others and the welfare of society. All such efforts are part of your Buddhist practice to accumulate \u201ctreasures of the heart\u201d (WND-1, 851). Your work and your Buddhist practice are not separate. Rather, your Buddhist practice and Soka Gakkai activities are the power source for making your work the most valuable and meaningful.\n\nChallenging and polishing ourselves in accord with this passage from the Daishonin\u2019s writings is a proud Soka Gakkai tradition.\n\nMany members in the early days of our movement faced harsh opposition to their Buddhist practice in the workplace. But taking to heart [Mr. Toda\u2019s guidance]\u2014\u201cIn faith, do the work of one; in your job, do the work of three\u201d\u2014they strove to do their best both at work and in their Buddhist practice. Determined to show actual proof on the job, they chanted earnestly and made all-out efforts. Facing their difficulties head-on, they chanted daimoku with firm resolve, applied themselves with integrity, and worked harder than anyone.\n\nA person\u2019s attitude toward work reflects their attitude toward life and other people; it reflects their beliefs about their purpose in living. The most profound, powerful, and sound philosophy for living is faith in Nichiren Buddhism.\n\nEach of you has the supreme and unparalleled life purpose of realizing kosen-rufu, of creating world peace and happiness for all humanity. To do your best each day at work based on the great vow for kosen-rufu is the spirit to \u201cregard your service to your lord as the practice of the Lotus Sutra\u201d (WND-1, 905). As a young person striving to achieve this, the world\u2019s greatest vow, please chant with a strong and grand determination to become the best person in the world at your job and to make your workplace or your company the best in the world!\n\nFaith is shown in your strength and ability as an individual. Therefore, please chant earnestly, study hard, exert yourself, be creative and enterprising, and throw all your youthful energy into your work. Doing so will bring you wonderful results. Even if things don\u2019t go the way you\u2019d hoped, chant more daimoku, try again, and open up new horizons. That is exactly what I have done.\n\nKnowing that I had received instruction and training from the best mentor in the world, I was resolved to be the best in the world at whatever job I did. And I chanted and exerted myself to demonstrate Mr. Toda\u2019s greatness through my work.\n\nRemember that whether you win or lose in work and life doesn\u2019t depend upon the size of your company or the work environment. It all depends on you. It depends on your determination, your attitude.\n\nFrom \u201cTo My Young Friends\u2014Leaders of a New Age,\u201d published in Japanese in the Seikyo Shimbun, May 22, 2012.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1From T\u2019ien-t\u2019ai\u2019s Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.12]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.14]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-14.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.14]\n20.14 Those Who Are Strong Stand Alone\nPresident Ikeda stresses that what is vital in youth is the courage to stand alone.\n\nThe German poet and playwright Friedrich von Schiller declared that the strong individual is strongest when acting alone.*1 I have treasured these words since my youth.\n\nIt is not good to blindly follow the crowd. Going along with something without any real thought, just because everyone is doing it, or being quite content with not having to make any decisions yourself, leads to mental laziness and apathy. And that\u2019s dangerous. When everyone says that war is good, everyone rushes to war, without dissent or opposition, even if they know it spells disaster. No one has the courage to stand up and bravely declare: \u201cWar is wrong!\u201d They just go along with the current social climate and whatever appears to be popular at the time.\n\nBut we mustn\u2019t be led astray. We must never abandon our commitment to peace, our desire to learn, and our love for humanity. Putting those values into practice ourselves and encouraging others to share them, too, takes courage. Courage lies inside us. It is something we must rouse from within.\n\nMindlessly following the crowd is not courage, but cowardice. It\u2019s fascism, not democracy. In a democracy, we each have to recognize that we are society\u2019s protagonists and as such have a responsibility to fulfill. Instead, there\u2019s too much self-interest\u2014the attitude that \u201cso long as I\u2019m happy, that\u2019s all that matters\u201d\u2014and too much blind following\u2014the mentality that \u201cit\u2019s safer to go along with what everyone else says.\u201d\n\nOnly when people have the courage to stand alone can they lead the world in the direction of peace and good. When such courageous individuals join forces and unite in strong solidarity, they can change society. But it all starts with you. You have to be courageous. The rest all follows from that.\n\nCourage is inseparable from justice. It is the determination to do what\u2019s right, to build a just society, and to follow the correct path as a human being. It is doing good, taking positive action, not only for ourselves, but for humanity and the world as well. To do this, we need the indispensable power of courage. Our efforts may not call attention to themselves but, in reality, they shine with unsurpassed brilliance.\n\nIt takes courage to put a stop to bullying. It takes courage to endure hardships and survive tough circumstances. It takes amazing courage to lead good, productive lives, day after day. And it also takes tremendous courage to share our opinions with our families and friends so that everyone, ourselves included, can move in a more positive direction.\n\nThose with the courage to do what is right, no matter what others say, possess a \u201cprecious sword\u201d of limitless power. In Buddhism, such people are called bodhisattvas and Buddhas.\n\nPeople of genuine courage have no underhanded motivations. They are straightforward and honest\u2014which is why they are often misunderstood and even treated as villains. In contrast, there are others who are skillful manipulators, who scheme and self-promote to gain popularity. Many people are fooled by their apparent success, and even envy them.\n\nHowever others may be, those who have done what is right\u2014even if misunderstood, scorned, or harassed as a result\u2014have a clear conscience. They are victors.\n\nTrue courage is defined by whether it is motivated by justice and compassion. Mr. Toda used to say:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for us ordinary mortals to have compassion. Emotions get in the way, or we just can\u2019t be bothered. Though compassion is important, it\u2019s difficult for us. But we can have courage. Practically speaking, having courage is our way of acting with compassion.\u201d\n\nAnd in fact, if we act with courage, we find that our compassion for others actually grows deeper. Courage is indeed the highest virtue.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth II, published in Japanese in September 2000.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Cf. Friedrich von Schiller, Wilhelm Tell, translated and edited by William F. Mainland (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1973), p. 24.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.13]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.15]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-15.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.15]\n20.15 Personal Relationships\nResponding to questions from high school students, President Ikeda discusses friendship and relationships from various perspectives.\n\nFriendship is the most beautiful, powerful, and precious thing in life. It is your greatest treasure. No matter how successful or wealthy a person is, without friends, life is sad and lonely. A lack of friends can also lead to a narrow, self-centered existence.\n\nIn this vast universe, we have been born together at the same time on this tiny planet. And how rare is it to find, among the 5.8 billion*1 members of the human race, truly caring and honest friends who understand our thoughts and feelings without the need for a lot of words and with whom we can relax and be ourselves.\n\nEven being in the same class at school with someone is the result of a profound connection. Some of you may have found genuine friends among your classmates. If you have, please treasure them. But if you feel you don\u2019t have any close friends right now, please don\u2019t worry. Just decide that the reason you don\u2019t have any now is so you\u2019ll be able to make the most wonderful friends later on. Concentrate your energies now on becoming the best person you can. In the future, you might even make friends all over the world.\n\nIn any event, friendship is up to you, not the other person. It all depends on you. I hope you will be loyal and true friends, not fair-weather friends who are there when all is well, but disappear when something bad happens.\n\nAnd when you graduate from school, I hope you will have grown to be generous, warmhearted people who can say to your friends with all honesty: \u201cI will never forget you. If you ever have a problem or something you want to talk about, don\u2019t hesitate to come to me. And I hope I can go to you, too.\u201d\n*\n[What kind of advice would you give someone who feels that a friend has suddenly started to treat them coldly, but has no idea why?]\n\nI think the best thing to do at such times is gather your courage and ask what\u2019s wrong. In many cases, you\u2019ll probably be surprised to find that what you imagined wasn\u2019t your friend\u2019s intention at all. Quite often, when you distance yourself from a friend because you\u2019re too afraid to ask what\u2019s wrong, the other person may in fact also be feeling hurt and lonely.\n\nHuman relationships are like a mirror. Often when you are thinking, \u201cIf my friend were only a bit nicer to me, I\u2019d be more open with her,\u201d your friend may well be thinking, \u201cIf only she were more open with me, I\u2019d be nicer to her.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to be the one who starts the conversation. If you still get a cold response, then you know that the problem lies with your friend, not with you.\n\nSometimes, there\u2019s nothing we can do about the way others feel. People\u2019s hearts change. What do you do when that happens? Adopt the attitude, \u201cThough others may change, I never will.\u201d If you are treated coldly or someone lets you down, resolve not to do the same to others. Those who betray others\u2019 trust only hurt themselves, as if they are driving a spike into their own hearts, without even being aware of it.\n\nShakyamuni is described as a person who always made the effort to reach out and speak to others\u2014something that you need to be strong in order to do.\n\nThere may be times in life when others let you down or disappoint you. Nichiren Daishonin was betrayed by many of his followers, even though he was the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law. I\u2019ve had people turn against me, too, people for whom I\u2019d done a great deal. But I was never surprised at all; rather, it\u2019s something I came to expect.\n\nAt such times, you need to be brave. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong, so just go on living with self-confidence and assurance. Those who betray or bully others are in the wrong. They are to be pitied.\n\nIf a friend betrays your trust, just forge new friendships. Don\u2019t lose your trust in everyone just because someone has hurt you. If you don\u2019t trust anyone you may avoid being hurt or disappointed, but you\u2019ll become a closed, narrow person. In truth, those who have suffered deeply are able to be kinder to others. You have to be strong.\n\nBe like the sun. Not all of the light of the sun falls on planets that will reflect it back. The sun\u2019s rays also spread out into empty space, seemingly wasted. Yet, the sun still goes on shining brightly.\n\nYou may find that those who reject the radiant light of your friendship will naturally fade out of your lives. But the more you shine your light, the more brilliant your own lives will become. Follow the path that you believe in, no matter what others think or do. If you remain constant and stay true to yourselves, others will definitely one day come to understand your sincere intent.\n\nYou are also fortunate in that you can chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. I know of many people who suffered from bullying, but when they challenged their situations through earnestly chanting, they suddenly found one day that the bullying had stopped. Through chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo when you are suffering, you can quite naturally overcome that suffering, almost without being aware of it. Often it\u2019s only when you look back that you realize it.\n\nI hope you will also chant for your friends. That is the greatest expression of friendship.\n\nYou may have friends who are sick, who cannot attend school, or are struggling to cope with problems at home. Whatever the case may be, the best thing you can do is to chant for them. Your prayers, like radio waves, though invisible, will definitely reach them.\n\nIt is also important to chant for those you don\u2019t like, find hard to get along with, or feel resentful toward. It may be difficult and perhaps even impossible for you to do so at first. But if you keep trying and chant for them, the situation will change. Perhaps you will change, or they will change. Either way, the situation will move in a more positive direction. Many people have experienced this firsthand. Above all, becoming a person who is able to chant for the happiness of such challenging individuals will be your greatest fortune.\n\nThe influence of friends is sometimes stronger than that of parents or anyone else. If you have good friends, friends who are trying to improve and develop themselves, you\u2019ll improve and grow, too. Andrew Carnegie, the American steel magnate, modestly attributed his success to having gathered around him people who were far more talented and capable than he. This was his philosophy of life. The only way to make good friends is to be a good friend yourself. Good people gather around other good people.\n*\nI hope you will be accepting and supportive of others. Please become people with hearts as broad as a great river, as wide as the ocean, and as vast as the blue sky. Wonderful friendships will unfold from such big hearts.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth, published in Japanese in March 1999.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1The world\u2019s population was estimated to be around 5.8 billion in 1996, when this essay was originally published in the Seikyo Shimbun.

This is one of the stages of life. You are entering a new period in your life, just as the sun marks a new day by rising brightly at dawn.\n\nEveryone\u2019s concerns about love and relationships are different. It depends on your personality, your situation, and your environment. There is no one single approach that will solve everyone\u2019s problems. In addition, everyone is perfectly free to fall in love or be attracted to someone. Who you decide to go out with or have a relationship with is your own choice, and it\u2019s not really anyone else\u2019s business.\n\nThe only advice I would like to give you on this subject, as an older friend, is not to let your relationship make you lose sight of pursuing your all-important personal development.\n\nThe purpose of your studies and after-school activities, such as team sports and clubs, is to build a foundation for your life, to make you a strong person. Worries about your personality and your relations with friends are also nutrients for building a strong self.\n\nThe same is true of love. Love should help you grow as a person; it should invigorate you and help you realize your full potential. This is the basic premise. But as the saying \u201cLove is blind\u201d suggests, when people are in love, they often lose the ability to see themselves objectively.\n\nIf you allow your new relationship to worry your parents, to lead you into bad behavior, or to stop you from studying, then you and your partner are acting as negative influences on, or hindrances to, each other. Neither of you will be happy if you just end up hurting one another.\n\nThe question is: Does the person you like inspire you to work harder at your studies or distract you from them? Does their presence make you more determined to devote greater energies to after-school activities, be a better friend, a more thoughtful son or daughter? Do they inspire you to realize your future goals and work to achieve them? Or is that person your central focus, overshadowing all else, including your after-school activities, your friends and family, and even your goals for the future?\n\nA relationship in which you both forget what you should be doing now, your goals and aims, is not good for either of you. A healthy relationship is one in which two people encourage each other to reach their respective goals while sharing each other\u2019s hopes and dreams. A relationship should be a source of inspiration, invigoration, and hope to live your lives to the fullest.\n\nDante Alighieri is one of the greatest poets who ever lived. His great love, Beatrice, was his inspiration in life. He loved her from the time he was a boy, and then happened to meet her again by chance when he was eighteen. He wrote of the deep emotion he felt on that occasion in his poem \u201cLa Vita Nuova\u201d (The New Life). As Dante struggled to find a way to express his feelings for Beatrice, he invented a new poetic form. Beatrice opened the door of artistic creation for him.\n\nBut his love for Beatrice would never be requited. She married another man, and died young. Yet, Dante kept loving her. His love forged, elevated, and deepened his spirit into something more lofty and noble. In his lifework, The Divine Comedy, Beatrice is depicted as a gentle, benevolent being who guides him to heaven.\n\nOf course, Dante lived in a different age and perhaps a different country from you. But I think there are many things to be learned from this great poet who stayed true to his own feelings, whether they were reciprocated or not, and transformed them into his guiding inspiration in life. I truly believe that love should be a positive impetus for our lives, the driving force for living with strength and courage.\n\nFrom Discussions on Youth, published in Japanese in March 1999.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.15]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.17]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-17.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.17]\n20.17 Guidance on Marriage\nIn The New Human Revolution, Shin\u2019ichi Yamamoto (whose character represents President Ikeda) engages in a discussion with young people during a visit to Italy in June 1981 and shares some thoughts on the subject of marriage.\n\n\u201cNaturally, marriage is a personal choice,\u201d Shin\u2019ichi said, \u201cbut it cannot be denied that young people often lack life experience and a certain degree of maturity. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to seek advice from your parents and older people you know, so that when you finally marry, those who care about you will celebrate your decision.\n\n\u201cMarriage is a lifelong commitment to share each other\u2019s joys and sorrows. We never know what kind of destiny we may confront or what challenges lie ahead. For couples to overcome such obstacles, it is of course important for them to love and care for one another; but it is also important for them to advance with a common purpose based on a foundation of shared philosophy and core beliefs.\n\n\u201cWhen both partners practice Nichiren Buddhism, I hope they will strive to build a relationship of mutual support and inspiration in which both can polish their faith and character.\n\n\u201cIf you get into a relationship that causes you to grow distant from the organization, lose your joy in faith, and stop growing and improving, only you will suffer.\u201d\n\nNichiren Buddhism gives us the power to ride out life\u2019s rough waves. The path to building indestructible happiness is found on the front lines of Soka Gakkai activities. Our dedicated efforts for kosen-rufu bring us precious good fortune, each step we take along the way enabling us to transform our karma and open the way to a life of happiness and joy. That\u2019s why Shin\u2019ichi stressed to the youth that they must never allow the flame of their faith to go out.\n\n\u201cIn recent years,\u201d Shin\u2019ichi continued, \u201cthere seems to be a global trend toward marriages ending quickly in divorce.\n\n\u201cBut when someone who is practicing Nichiren Buddhism faces marital problems, I believe that, if they keep exerting themselves strongly in their practice, make a fresh determination in faith, and try hard to find a solution with their partner, they can, in many cases, wisely overcome their difficulties. The key, at any rate, is to have firm faith.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of our Buddhist practice is to lead good lives, become happy, and illuminate society with the light of hope.\n\n\u201cTo that end, please nurture loving relationships as couples, create fine families, win the trust and respect of those around you, and be people who demonstrate the greatness of Nichiren Buddhism.\u201d\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 30, \u201cBells of Dawn\u201d chapter.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.16]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.18]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-18.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.18]\n20.18 \u201cLearning Is Light, Ignorance Is Darkness\u201d\nThose who keep learning throughout life remain youthful. President Ikeda discusses the importance of cultivating the habit of learning while we are young.\n\nThere is a Russian saying: \u201cLearning is light, ignorance is darkness.\u201d Of course, \u201clearning\u201d here does not refer only to studying at a university. In a broader sense, learning is self-improvement, while ignorance is stagnation. The spirit of learning leads to peace, progress, and prosperity, while ignorance leads to misery, misfortune, and impoverishment.\n\nIn my youth, I studied while working. Around 1950, when Mr. Toda\u2019s businesses were in serious trouble, was the most difficult period for me, as I was also in poor health. Yet, I never felt unhappy. Spending my days working alongside the person I had chosen as my mentor, I hadn\u2019t the slightest regret. My only frustration was that I couldn\u2019t study as much as I wanted to.\n\nAs if he knew my thoughts, Mr. Toda said to me: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will teach you everything you would learn at a university. Just be patient. Leave your education to me.\u201d\n\nFrom that time, I spent every Sunday at Mr. Toda\u2019s home, receiving private instruction from him. With his wide-ranging scholarship, which encompassed government, economics, literature, physics, astronomy, and other fields of science, he became a perfect tutor, imparting to me all of the knowledge he had acquired in his lifetime.\n\nEventually, in addition to Sundays, the classes expanded to weekday mornings before work. Mr. Toda\u2019s classes were extremely demanding. Through this training by my mentor in the midst of our arduous struggles, I built the foundation for my life.\n\nMr. Toda was always studying. Two weeks before he died, he sternly asked me what I had been reading, adding: \u201cNever forget to keep reading. I\u2019m presently up to volume three of the [ancient Chinese classic] Compendium of Eighteen Histories.\u201d At that time, he was extremely weak, to the extent that he could no longer stand or walk unaided. The intense resonance of his voice, however, still reverberates in my ears.\n\nThose who continue learning, who stay active and engaged, remain forever young. Lives that continue improving are like the water of a ceaselessly flowing river, always fresh and pure.\n\nOf the many people I have met, it was the eminent British historian Arnold J. Toynbee who impressed me most deeply with his unwavering devotion to learning.\n\nAfter repeated invitations from Professor Toynbee, I had the opportunity to meet and engage in discussion with him for a total of forty hours over ten days in 1972 and 1973. The content of our dialogue was published in 1975. Since then it has been translated into English under the title of Choose Life, as well as into French, German, and many other languages, and been well received around the world. I am delighted at the result, hoping it might repay in some small way the sincerity of Professor Toynbee, who took the time to engage in those lengthy discussions with me, someone many years his junior.\n\nThe year after our dialogue ended, Professor Toynbee was incapacitated by illness. Unfortunately, the outlook for his recovery was not good, and it appears that he never fully regained his faculties. In a letter I received from his wife, Veronica, she wrote that even in that condition her husband asked for books, and although it was doubtful that he could actually read, he turned the pages as if he could.\n\nI was deeply moved by this. Even when illness deprived him of his full awareness, Professor Toynbee\u2019s dedicated efforts in scholarly research had become an expression of his life itself, always seeking to learn and aiming higher. I felt he was the model of a great individual, who fully deserved of the recognition he had gained as one of the leading thinkers of the 20th century.\n\nIt is easy to pay lip service to lifelong learning. With Japan\u2019s emergence as an economic superpower, its people have more free time. They engage in a wide range of hobbies. But simply having the time and attending classes somewhere won\u2019t guarantee inner enrichment. The key is whether one has a vibrant desire to improve and grow.\n\nProfessor Toynbee kept books beside him even when he was bedridden. Learning had become a habit, a good habit, for him. Those who acquire that habit when they are young are fortunate.\n\nIn the workplace and the home, as well as in the events of daily life, we can always find precious opportunities to learn. There are those who use five spare minutes to read a newspaper, open a book, listen to the news, or gain something from an encounter with another person. Though they may seem busy, such people are able to transform that very busyness into learning. Laziness is the first step toward stagnation. Let us lead lives nourished by the rich wellspring of a love of learning, maintaining a lively interest and curiosity about everything.\n\nFrom Kokoro no shiki (Seasons of the Heart), published in Japanese in May 1993.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.17]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.19]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-19.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.19]\n20.19 Be Suns Illuminating a New World\nPresident Ikeda offers advice to SGI-USA youth division members on life and faith.\n\nYouth is a time full of worries and problems. Young people\u2019s hearts are constantly vacillating. You are worried about your future, your personality, relationships, social issues, and life in general. You are confused and anxious. You are troubled by the gap between ideals and reality, and may sometimes fall into self-hatred and become consumed with insecurity and fear.\n\nYouth is a season of emotional turmoil and suffering. This is the reality of youth, no matter what the country. In a certain sense, that\u2019s how it should be. You are not the only ones suffering like this, and in this period of change and growth, these feelings probably can\u2019t be helped.\n\nThe important thing is not to be impatient. You can\u2019t attain peace of mind nor social stability all at once. It takes time.\n\nIf a plane tries to take off without taxiing down the runway and gradually building up speed, it won\u2019t succeed. And even if it takes off, if it lacks sufficient fuel and good maintenance, it won\u2019t stay in the air long. It may even crash.\n\nLife and Buddhist practice are like a marathon. You may at times run out front and at times fall behind. But what matters is the final moment at the finish line.\n\nThe training you undergo in your youth is all for that final, true victory. That\u2019s why you need to study as hard as you can now. Keep chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and build up a reservoir of life force.\n\nSteadily move ahead on the fundamental path of putting your faith into practice in life, in your own distinct way.\n\nThe sun rises every day. It never takes a break. If you do the same, persistently forging ahead in accord with the Mystic Law, the ultimate law of the universe, you will come to enjoy a wonderful life of complete satisfaction and fulfillment, far surpassing anything you imagined. Please be assured that this is the most certain and valuable way to spend your youth.\n*\nWe are pioneers embracing this great philosophy, of which so much of humankind is still unaware. It is, therefore, extremely important to demonstrate just how wonderful Nichiren Buddhism truly is by showing actual proof of its benefit in our lives. Seeing such proof will enable people to realize the greatness and originality of this Buddhism and see that it is different from anything they have encountered before.\n\nNichiren Daishonin writes: \u201cEven more valuable than reason and documentary proof is the proof of actual fact\u201d (WND-1, 599).\n\nOf course, you shouldn\u2019t overreach yourselves just trying to show proof. All you need do is present an example of steadily seeking to improve and develop yourselves in the way most natural for you\u2014in your daily lives, in your families, your workplaces, your communities, and in your character.\n\nJust carry out your human revolution in your own way. In doing so, you will naturally come to impress others with your vitality, hope, conviction, and reassuring presence. That, in itself, will build the foundation for sharing Nichiren Buddhism with others, without any need for words.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to rush in our efforts to share Buddhism. I feel it\u2019s better to be strict and uphold sound standards for membership, rather than just increase our numbers.\n\nAll people have a fabulous \u201cnew world\u201d\u2014a yet-undiscovered-realm\u2014within them. It is called the world of Buddhahood. But most of humanity is still not aware of its existence.\n\nOur Buddhist practice is the effort to fully tap and activate this \u201cnew world\u201d of Buddhahood, a realm of infinite power and potential.\n\nOnce we awaken to the world of Buddhahood within us, our lives are filled with unsurpassed joy. An entirely \u201cnew world\u201d also opens up in our lives and in society. Communicating this to others is our mission.\n\nFrom a speech at an SGI-USA youth training session, U.S.A., February 26, 1990.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.18]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.20]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-20.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.20]\n20.20 Cherish High Ideals\nThrough the guidance of second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda, President Ikeda calls on young people to strive with all their might to realize high ideals.\n\nNaturally, there are many different ways to live your youth, and there is no need to suggest a single approach for everyone. But whatever path you choose, what will play a decisive role in the direction your life takes into the future is whether you live the days of your youth to the fullest or let them slip by without making any real effort.\n\nPresident Toda often gave us guidance to the effect: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do something big, it\u2019s important that you have the determination to achieve it in your 20s and 30s. If you wait until you\u2019re in your forties, and then suddenly decide to embark on some great venture, it becomes that much more difficult to succeed.\u201d\n\nHe also advised: \u201cYoung people should cherish dreams that seem almost too big to accomplish. Inevitably in life, we\u2019re only able to achieve a fraction of what we\u2019d like to. So if your dreams are too small to begin with, you\u2019ll end up not being able to accomplish anything. What good, then, will you have created with your life?\u201d\n\nStriving to realize a high ideal in your twenties and thirties is the key to enjoying unsurpassed satisfaction and fulfillment in this seemingly long yet short existence.\n\nYou\u2019re only young once. How unfortunate it would be to reach your forties and fifties and be filled with sadness and regret. A life of discontent\u2014a life unfulfilled and half-realized like a sputtering, smoldering fire that never leaps into bright flames\u2014is also a terrible waste.\n\nThat\u2019s why you should burn your brightest and strive your hardest in your youth when you are at the height of your powers and your health. It is all for your own benefit.\n\nMr. Toda taught that young people should cherish high ideals and advance with bright, burning energy. The higher the summit you aim for, the greater the satisfaction you will savor when you reach the peak. This is a way of life filled with passion and growth, brimming with the limitless power of faith in the Mystic Law.\n\nKosen-rufu is the supreme summit for humankind, the most meaningful and noble ideal. It is also the most realistic ideal, and one that is most urgently needed by society and the times. Dedicate your youth and your life, fully and without reservation, to the great ideal of kosen-rufu. Such a life accords with the teachings of Nichiren Daishonin and embodies the essence of the unchanging Soka Gakkai spirit.\n\nFrom a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Tokyo, January 20, 1988.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.19]\nPart 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.21]"}, {"title": "chapter-20-21.html", "content": "Part 2: Human Revolution\nChapter 20: Encouragement for Youth [20.21]\n20.21 Ushering in a New Dawn of Human Rights\nOn the anniversary of March 16\u2014Kosen-rufu Day\u2014in 1991, President Ikeda sent a message to the youth division. He spoke of Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s powerful declaration for human rights and called on the youth to continue that noble struggle.\n\nI have here with me a book published by UNESCO to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [in 1968]. Titled Birthright of Man, it is a compilation of quotes on human rights from individuals around the world, past and present. The words of Nichiren Daishonin are included, a passage that appears in \u201cThe Selection of the Time.\u201d It is his defiant declaration to the de facto ruler of the time, Hei no Saemon-no-jo, after returning to Kamakura from exile on Sado Island: \u201cEven if it seems that, because I was born in the ruler\u2019s domain, I follow him in my actions, I will never follow him in my heart\u201d (WND-1, 579).*1\n\nThe Daishonin is saying: \u201cYou are the ruling authority. You have the power to send me into exile and then grant me my freedom. But you do not have the power to control my heart. I will never be a slave to you or anyone else in power.\u201d\n\nHis declaration encapsulates a core tenet of his life.\n\nThe Daishonin spent his entire life fighting against despotism, armed solely with the power of the spirit and the power of reason. His words from \u201cThe Selection of the Time\u201d keenly convey his self-confidence and conviction: \u201cYou may be a king in the political realm, but I am king in the spiritual realm.\u201d\n\nAs I contemplate these words, the lion\u2019s roar of my mentor, Josei Toda, also echoes in my heart\u2014his proud declaration at the ceremony of March 16, 1958, that \u201cthe Soka Gakkai is the king of the religious world.\u201d\n\nThat declaration inspired his disciples to action. We strove day and night, until the Daishonin\u2019s words, after 700 years, began to illuminate the entire world.\n\nUnder the brilliant sunlight of this reality, all insinuations and intrigues against our organization are as fleeting as dew.\n\nIn the UNESCO publication, the Daishonin\u2019s words appear in a chapter titled \u201cLimitations on Power.\u201d\n\nEven the greatest worldly power cannot enslave the human spirit, stifle cries of freedom, or destroy justice. And above all, it cannot hide the truth for long.\n\nThis book is just one example of how people around the world see Nichiren Daishonin\u2019s life as a struggle for human rights, recognizing and praising him as a great pioneer in advocating that cause.\n\nWe of the Soka Gakkai are carrying on the Daishonin\u2019s struggle in modern times and are advancing it around the world as a great people\u2019s movement.\n\nIn Japan, there has never before been such a substantial grassroots struggle for human rights. Perhaps for that reason, the Japanese are only dimly aware of the importance of human rights. That makes it hard for them to grasp our movement\u2019s noble significance.\n\nThose insensitive to human rights find it easy to violate them. In the end, they may discover that their own human rights have been taken away. We must not allow the arrival of such a terrible age; we must usher in a new dawn of human rights. That is the mission of youth. That is your mission.\n\nFrom a message commemorating March 16, Kosen-rufu Day, published in the Seikyo Shimbun, March 16, 1991.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Cf.

This is portrayed by Shin\u2019ichi Yamamoto (whose character represents President Ikeda) delivering a speech in November 2001 at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting commemorating the anniversary of the organization\u2019s founding.\n\nIn his speech at that meeting, Shin\u2019ichi thanked everyone for their efforts and urged them to forge ahead courageously, determined never to be defeated. He asked that they always base themselves on faith and keep moving forward, no matter what happens in life. That, he said, is the spirit of practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism. He then said to the youth, wishing to pass the baton to them: \u201cThe development of kosen-rufu depends on the existence of genuine disciples!\u201d\n\nThe great undertaking of kosen-rufu cannot be accomplished in a single lifetime. It can only be achieved when that mission is passed on from the mentor to the disciples, who in turn pass it on to the disciples of future generations.\n\nShin\u2019ichi\u2019s voice rang with resolve: \u201cI will never forget what Mr. Toda said at a meeting of the young men\u2019s division Suiko-kai:*1 \u2018As long as there is a core of youth\u2014no, even a single true disciple\u2014we will achieve kosen-rufu.\u2019\n\n\u201cWho has been that one disciple? Who has given his life to spreading Nichiren Buddhism around the world, just as Mr. Toda taught? I am proud and confident to say that I am that one disciple.\n\n\u201cI would like you, my young friends of the youth division, to staunchly carry on the solemn spirit of the first three Soka Gakkai presidents, who are eternally linked by the bonds of mentor and disciple. Those who do so will be the ultimate victors. This is also the fundamental path for the Soka Gakkai\u2019s ongoing success in the 21st century. It is the way for us to fulfill the great vow for kosen-rufu and create lasting world peace.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m counting on you, the members of the young men\u2019s division, young women\u2019s division, and student division! I\u2019m counting on all Soka youth around the world!\u201d\n\nThe members responded enthusiastically, their youthful voices resounding through the hall.\n\nPortraits of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Josei Toda, the Soka Gakkai\u2019s first and second presidents, hung on the walls at the back of the room. To Shin\u2019ichi, it seemed that both were smiling and nodding in approval, warmly watching over the youth and everyone present, enfolding them in their compassionate gaze.\n\nIn his heart, he called out to the youth: \u201cLet\u2019s set forth together! As long as we live, let\u2019s fight! Let\u2019s advance with confidence and vigor as we vibrantly ring in the second series of Seven Bells!\u201d\n\nIn his mind\u2019s eye, Shin\u2019ichi had an uplifting vision of the youth of Soka as majestic young eagles bathed in the dawning light of the third millennium. He saw them soaring, in an unending stream, into the vast skies of the world.\n\nThey were the countless multitudes of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth,*2 forever dedicated to fulfilling the great vow for kosen-rufu.\n\nFrom The New Human Revolution, vol. 30, \u201cVow\u201d chapter.\nThe Wisdom for Creating Happiness and Peace brings together selections from President Ikeda\u2019s works on key themes.\n*1Suiko-kai: The Suiko-kai (Water Margin Group) was a young men\u2019s division training group formed by second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda.
